@This is the ESPS 6.0 SETUP script help file, based on the Entropic install.hlp
script, included in the ESPS 6.0 source tree as as install.hlp.historic

usage: ./SETUP options

Options are:

-p	<dir> sets SPSDIR to <dir>.  This is the target installation directory.
-h	prints this file.
-M	<type> specify "machine" (really operating system) type.

Normal first time install is:

./SETUP [-p <dir>]
./INSTALL

SETUP attempts to detect the operating system using uname and by default will
install to /usr/esps.  The -M option overrides the result of uname and the -p
option overrides /usr/esps.
