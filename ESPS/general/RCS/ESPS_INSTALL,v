@# This script is meant to be run after the SETUP script in the same directory.
# In particular, it assumes that an emake program and ESPS_BASE file,
# correct for the system being installed, are present in this directory, and
# that the $ESPS_BASE directory tree has been created and a number of include
# and library files have been copied into it.

export EMAKE_DIR=`pwd`
export ESPS_BASE=`cat ESPS_BASE`
# There may be old versions of esps utility programs such as emake,
# get_esps_base, diffmk in the $PATH, or no version at all if this is a fresh
# install. During installation, we use the ones in this directory and possibly
# ones that have been freshly installed.
# Be careful not to put any executables in this directory with the names of
# standard system programs.  E.g., this script is called ESPS_INSTALL,
# rather than install, so as not to interfere with the standard install
# invoked by make.
