.SH NAME
tek2ps \- convert Tektronix\*R 4014 commands to PostScript\*R
.SH SYNTAX
tek2ps [-p \fIprologfile\fR] [-e] [-s \fIscale] files
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -p
will use the named prologfile instead of the default (currently
/mnt/cmb/msf/tek2ps/tekps.pro).
.IP -e
will make `erase' (ESC FF) and `hardcopy' (ESC ETB) synonymous: each will
print the current page and then erase it.  The default will erase without
printing or print without erasing.
.IP -s
will scale the entire plot by the per centage specified.  The default maps
the Tektronix screen to an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tek2ps will take any output designed to be displayed on a Tektronix 4014
terminal and translate it to PostScript suitable for sending to any PostScript
device.  Some manual editing will probably be required if the PostScript
is to be included in another file.  Tek2ps supports 10 and 12-bit addressing
modes, incremental plots, and defocussed Z axis.  It does
.I not
support crosshair (GIN) mode or special point plot (6-bit greyscale).
.PP
Multiple
.I files
may be specified; if none are listed standard input is read.  Output is to
standard output.
.SH EXAMPLE
plot -T4014 myplot | tek2ps | lpr -Plw
.SH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
.PP
If you place multiple screens in a single file, you must either use the
hardcopy command followed by an erase to prevent overwriting, or the
-e option.
