1) While xgrabsc can create puzzle picture files from monochrome screens, the
   puzzle program will not display pictures with "-picture" on monochrome
   systems. This is not a "bug" in xgrabsc, but is a "confusing feature".

2) If you run xgrabsc from a Twm menu, be sure to end your exec command with
   "&". The program may not be able to grab the pointer or server unless you
   do this.  This will likely happen with any window manager, but has been
   reported onlyfor Twm.

3) The xwdtoppm program appears to have problems reading xgrabsc XWD output.  I've
   looked into this problem a bit but have no quick solution for all platforms and
   compilers.  If "xwd | xwdtoppm | ppmtoxwd | xwud" works on your machine, you
   may try the simple fix of correcting the color-reading loop in xwdtoppm.c to
   terminate on reaching "ncolors" instead of "colormap-entries".  You should
   be able to use xgrabsc output once this is done.  The ppm bugs have been
   reported to the owner of that project.
