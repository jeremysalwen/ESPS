What should be added:

	* insert  mode in field  editing.  The  original  idea is that
	  most of the fields should be short and  there  is no need to
	  duplicate editor function in sf.  For novice user, they dont
	  know fancy commands  anyway; for expert  user, sf is  useful
	  only in  special  occasion.  This  delayed  the  addition of
	  extra editing function  (insert mode, delete  word,  move by
	  word, etc).

What should not be added:

	* Database function: I could not think of an  easy way so that
	  sf can read  standard Unix database  files like /etc/passwd,
	  /etc/ttys, any  idea?    It   will  be good   to have  these
	  functions, but again, it violate Unix principle: "doing just
	  one thing".

Something to think about:

	* scroll region
	* multiple forms, chaining to different form files.
	* range checking.
	* pipe field data to Unix program and put result back.
