This is sf (shell form) version 1.8.  Having used so many high quality
programs from the net, this is my time to contribute.

This  program  was written to   augment the versatility  of  Unix user
interface in shell level.   It does  only  one  thing -- form editing.
Shell script writer has to process the data afterwards.

Some typical usage for this program are:

    o interface for non-Unix user  to access system  resource. One can
      easily write shell  scripts  display menus and forms  for novice
      users.

    o Something like bulletin board system might use sf interface.

    o I personally  use   it   to interface  with those commands  with
      zillions of  options  (e.g.,  stty, sa, admin,  cpio)  or  those
      commands used infrequently   (e.g., print).  I  used capitalized
      command  names for those  shell scripts with sf interface, e.g.,
      Stty for stty, Admin for admin, etc.

    o With  proper database  interface  program,  sf  may be  used for
      system administrator to configure system, e.g.,  add new user to
      system, configure I/O ports,  etc.   The recently posted  "perl"
      might be a good candidate.

To build sf, simply type: "make".  Sf  has not been  tested on non-BSD
system,  some porting will  be   needed.  You might   want to run some
sample scripts supplied with the package to see how it works.  Enjoy!

Sample scripts:

	Print	(csh)	interface to BSD 4.2 print command
	Stty	(sh)	interface to BSD 4.3 stty command
	Lib	(csh)	maintain on-line library index (need modification)
