.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I cross_cor
takes as input
a pair of single-channel, real ESPS sampled-data (SD or FEA_SD) files
and produces an ESPS feature (FEA) file as output.
The program reads a set of fixed-length frames from the first input file.
For each such frame,
it reads a corresponding frame from the second input file (see \-N option),
computes the cross correlation between the two frames
at a fixed set of lags,
and writes an output record containing the cross-correlation values.
.PP
All input frames have the same length
.I frame_len
(see
.B \-l
option).
The initial point of the first frame from
.I input1.sd
is a specified point in the file (see
.B \-p
option).
Initial points of any subsequent frames follow at equal intervals
.I step
(see
.B \-S
option).
Thus the 3 cases
.IR step " < " frame_len,
.IR step " = " frame_len,
and
.IR step " > " frame_len,
correspond to overlapping frames, exactly abutted frames,
and frames separated by gaps.
The initial point of the first frame from
.I input2.sd
is a specified point in that file (see
.B \-p
option), and subsequent frames follow at the same spacing as in
.I input1.sd.
The number of frames
is the minimum sufficient to cover a specified range of
.I nan
points (see
.B \-p
option).
The last frame in each file may overrun the range,
in which case a warning is printed.
If a frame overruns the end of a file, it is filled out with zeros.
.PP
The output file is not of any special feature-file subtype.
It is not tagged, but has two ordinary
.I long
scalar fields named "tag1" and "tag2",
which give the starting sample numbers
of the frames from the two input files.
The cross-correlation values are stored in a
.I float
vector field named "cross_cor" of length
.IR maxlag "\|-\|" minlag "\|+\|1"
where
.I minlag
and
.I maxlag
are the least and greatest lags for which the cross correlation is computed.
Values are stored for lags
.I minlag,
\&. . . , 0, . . . ,
.I maxlag
in that order.
.PP
The input files must be different.
One of the input file names may be replaced by `\-',
indicating standard input.
Likewise the output file name may be replaced by `\-',
indicating standard output.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-l " frame_len" "\fR [0]"
Specifies the length of each frame.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted.
A value of 0 (from either the option or the parameter file)
indicates that a single frame of length
.I nan
(see
.BR \-p )
is processed;
this is also the default value in case
.I frame_len
is not specified either with the
.B \-l
option or in the parameter file.
.TP
.BI \-o " minlag" : "maxlag" "\fR [\-10:10]"
.TP
.BI \-o " minlag" :+ "incr"
The range of lags for which the cross correlation is computed.
In the first form of the option,
a pair of integers specifies the first and last lags of the range.
If
.IR maxlag " = " minlag " + " incr,
the second form (with the plus sign) specifies the same range as the first.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted,
and if no value is found there, the default range of \-10 to 10 is used.
.TP
.BI \-p " first" : "last" "\fR [1:(last in file)]"
.TP
.BI \-p " first" :+ "incr"
Specifies the range of sampled data to analyze in each file.
This option may be specified at most twice.
If it is omitted, the ranges are determined by the parameters
.I start1,
.I start2,
and
.I nan
if they are present in the parameter file,
and by default values for the parameters if they are not present.
If the option is specified once, it applies to both input files.
If it is specified twice, the first instance applies to
.I input1.sd
and the second to
.I input2.sd.
If the option is specified twice,
and the two range specifications imply different values of
.I nan,
the smaller is used.
In the first form of the option,
a pair of unsigned integers
specifies the first and last samples of the range to be analyzed.
If 
.IR last " = " first " + " incr,
the second form (with the plus sign) specifies the same range as the first.
If
.I first
is omitted, the default value of 1 is used.
If
.I last
is omitted, the default is the last sample in the file.
.TP
.BI \-r " first" : "last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first" :+ "incr"
The
.B \-r
option is synonymous with
.BR \-p .
.TP
.BI \-w " window_type" "\fR[RECT]"
The name of the data window to apply to the data.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted,
and if no value is found there,
the default used is a rectangular window with amplitude one.
Possible window types include rectangular ("RECT"), Hamming ("HAMMING"),
Hanning ("HANNING"), cosine to the fourth power ("COS4"),
and triangular ("TRIANG");
see the manual page for window(3-ESPSsp) for the complete list.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level" "\fR [0]"
A positive value specifies
that debugging output be printed on the standard error output.
Larger values result in more output.
The default is 0, for no output.
.TP
.BI \-P " param" "\fR [params]"
The name of the parameter file.
The default name is "param".
The parameter file is optional (see ESPS Parameter).
.TP
.BI \-S " step" "\fR [" frame_len "\fR]"
Initial points of consecutive frames differ by this number of samples.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted,
and if no value is found there, a default equal to
.I frame_len
is used (resulting in exactly abutted frames).
.TP
.BI \-N
If this option is used a single frame is read from 
.I input2.sd.
Frames are read from 
.I input1.sd 
as described above and for each of them a single correlation (of lag 0) with 
the fixed frame of 
.I input2.sd
is computed.
The default value of 
.I frame_len
is the length of 
.I input2.sd
and the default value of 
.I step 
is then 
.I frame_len.
Note that there must be at least as many records in
.I input1.sd
as in 
.I input2.sd.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The parameter file is not required to be present, as there are default
values for all parameters.
If the file exists, the following parameters may be read
if they are not determined by command-line options.
.TP
.I "frame_len \- integer"
The number of points in each frame.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-l
option is specified.
A value of 0 indicates that a single frame of length
.I nan
(see below)
is processed;
this is also the default value in case
.I frame_len
is specified neither with the
.B \-l
option nor in the parameter file.
.TP
.I "nan \- integer"
The total number of points to process.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-p
option is specified.
If the option is not specified and the parameter is not present,
the default used is the length of a range extending either from
.I start1
to the end of
.I input1.sd
or from
.I start2
to the end of
.I input2.sd,
whichever is shorter.
.TP
.I "minlag \- integer"
The first lag
for which the cross correlation is computed.
This value is not read if the command-line option
.B \-o
is specified.
If the option is omitted and no value is found in the parameter file,
a default of \-10 is used.
.TP
.I "maxlag \- integer"
The last lag
for which the cross correlation is computed.
This value is not read if the command-line option
.B \-o
is specified.
If the option is omitted and no value is found in the parameter file,
a default of 10 is used.
.TP
.I "start1 \- integer"
The first point from the input file
.I input1.sd
that is processed.
A value of 1 denotes the first sample in the file.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-p
option is specified.
A default value of 1 is used
if the option is not specified and the parameter is not present.
.TP
.I "start2 \- integer"
The first point from the input file
.I input2.sd
that is processed.
A value of 1 denotes the first sample in the file.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-p
option is specified.
A default value of 1 is used
if the option is not specified and the parameter is not present.
.TP
.I "step \- integer"
Initial points of consecutive frames differ by this number of samples.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-S
option is specified.
If the option is omitted and no value is found in the parameter file,
a default equal to
.I frame_len
is used (resulting in exactly abutted frames).
.TP
.I "window_type \- string"
The data window to apply to the data.
This parameter is not read if the command-line option
.B \-w
is specified.
If the option is omitted and if no value is found in the parameter file,
the default used is "RECT", for a rectangular window with amplitude one.
Other acceptable values include
"HAMMING", for Hamming, and "TRIANG", for triangular;
see the window(3-ESPSsp) manual page for the complete list.
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
.PP
The ESPS common file is neither read nor written.
.SH "ESPS HEADERS"
.PP
.I Cross_cor
reads the value of
.I common.type
from the input sampled_data files
.I input1.sd
and
\fIinput2.sd\fP for type checking.
.PP
The two input files are given as source files in the output file header,
but neither is given as the reference file.
The output header contains field definitions for
.I tag1,
.I tag2,
and
.I cross_cor,
and generic header items that record the values of the parameters listed in
the ESPS Parameters section.
The parameter
.I window_type
is recorded in an item of type CODED;
the other parameters are recorded in items of type LONG.
.PP
In addition,
The generic header item \fIstart_time\fP (type DOUBLE) is written in
the output file.  The value written is computed by taking the
\fIstart_time\fP value from the header of the first input file (or zero, if
such a header item doesn't exist) and adding to it the offset time
(from the beginning of the first input file) of the first point processed
plus one half of \fIframe_len\fP.  (Thus, \fIstart_time\fP is in the 
middle of
the first frame, which is appropriate since the output data represent
the entire frame; without this adjustment for \fIframe_len\fP,
\fIwaves\fP+ displays would not line up properly.) 
Also,
the generic header item \fIrecord_freq\fP (type DOUBLE)
is written in the output
file.  The value is the number of output records per second of input
data from the first input file.
