/*
 * Read a PC WAVE "header" and construct a FEA_SD header that can be
 * passed to ESPS data input routines to allow them to read the PC WAVE
 * data samples.
 *
 * Assume "prefix" contains "num_read" bytes read from the beginning of
 * file "file" and that "file" is positioned for reading the following
 * characters.  If the catenation of "prefix"  with the remainder of
 * "file" begins with a PC WAVE header, this function reads in the rest
 * of the header material, creates a corresponding ESPS FEA_SD header,
 * and leaves the file positioned at the beginning of the data, ready for
 * reading of the binary samples that follow.
 *
 * In more detail, this means reading the "RIFF" chunk ID, the
 * four-byte chunk size, and the form type "WAVE"; skipping any
 * irrelevant chunks; extracting the information from the "fmt" chunk;
 * and reading the initial chunk ID "data" and the four-byte chunk size
 * of the data chunk.  No "LIST" data chunks are supported, only a simple
 * "data" chunk, and the format must be 16-bit PCM.  Multiple channels
 * are allowed, however.
 *
 * The items in the "fmt" chunk are saved in generic header items in the
 * FEA_SD header.  They are also saved in a "pc_wav_hd" structure, and a
 * pointer to the structure is saves as a long in the generic header item
 * "pc_wav_hd_ptr".  The generic header items "start_time" and
 * "record_freq" are initialized respectively to zero and to the value of
 * the WAVE "fmt" item "SamplesPerSec".
 *
 * The return value is a pointer to the FEA_SD header, or NULL in case
 * of error.
 *
 * This function is intended for use when it has been necessary to read
 * a number of characters at the beginning of a file to determine whether
 * it is in PC WAVE format or some other (such as FEA, Esignal, or NIST).
 * On a seekable input stream, it would be possible to simply rewind and
 * read all the header information directly from the file; however, the
 * function is intended to work on pipes.

/*
 * Function used by "pc_wav_to_feasd" to "read" PC WAVE "header"
 * information and create a pc_wav_hd structure containing it.  The
 * return value is a pointer to the structure, or NULL in case of error.
 *
 * The arguments are as for "pc_wav_to_feasd": the string "prefix"
 * contains a number "num_read" of bytes previously read from "file", so
 * that the complete PC WAVE file consists of the contents of "prefix"
 * followed by the remaining bytes in "file".  This function, and
 * functions used by it, keep track of progress through "prefix" by means
 * of a fixed pointer "end_pref" to the _end_ of the sequence of pre-read
 * bytes, and by decrementing "num_read".  When that count reaches zero,
 * the functions switch over from obtaining characters from "prefix" to
 * reading characters from "file".  Data-reading functions such as
 * "pc_wav_get_rec" and "pc_wav_getsd_recs" are not expected to go
 * through such contortions, so this function returns an error indication
 * if "num_read" has not become zero by the time the beginning of the
 * data samples has been reached.
 *
 * It is assumed that "prefix" contains at least the initial chunk ID
 * "RIFF", the RIFF chunk size, and the form type "WAVE", and that these
 * have been checked by "pc_wav_check_prefix".  Within the RIFF WAVE
 * chunk, any chunks with chunk IDs other than "fmt " or "data" are
 * skipped, and a "fmt " chunk is required before the "data" chunk.  The
 * function reads the items FormatTag, Channels, SamplesPerSec,
 * AvgBytesPerSec, and BlockAlign and for WAVE_FORMAT_PCM (the only
 * format currently supported) the format-specific item BitsPerSample.
 * It stores these items in the pc_wav_hd structure.  It exits after
 * reading the chunk ID and size of the "data" chunk.
