	  The NIST SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE) Package
			     Version 2.6


To install the SPHERE package from a CD-ROM:

	Recursively copy the "sphere" directory from the CD-ROM to a
	writable disk drive.  Then, change directory to the copied
	version and run the UNIX install command.  This can be
	accomplished on a UNIX system with the commands:

	    % cp -r sphere <YOUR_DIR>
	    % cd <YOUR_DIR>
	    % sh src/scripts/install.sh

To install the SPHERE package from a compressed-tar file:

	Extract the programs from the compressed-tar file then run the
	UNIX install command.  This can be accomplished on a UNIX system
	with the commands:

	    % zcat sphere_2.6.tar.Z | tar xvf -
	    % cd nist
	    % sh src/scripts/install.sh

For a description of SPHERE, read the files, 'doc/sphere.rdm' and
'doc/sphere.doc'.  UNIX-style man pages can be found in 'doc/man'.

If you're linking the sphere library with code written for SPHERE
version 2.0 or 2.1, the argument calls for sp_read_data and
sp_write_data have changed.  Section VI, "Linking to the SPHERE
library" in the document "doc/sphere.doc" describe ways to use the old
code without re-writing it.

This version of SPHERE has been tested on the following platforms:

	SUN OS 4.1.X using gcc
	SUN Solaris OS 5.4
	SGI IRIX Release 5.3
	DEC OSF/1 V2.0 using cc and gcc
