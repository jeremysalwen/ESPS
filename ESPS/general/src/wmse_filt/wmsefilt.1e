.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program
.I wmse_filt
designs a linear phase finite impulse response (FIR) 
filter and prints the coefficients to the FEAFILT file
.I feafilt_file.
The user specifies the number of coefficients, the desired
filter frequency response, and a weighting function.  The program then finds the
set of filter coefficients that minimizes the mean square error between
the desired response and the actual response, when weighted by the weighting
function.  In other words, for desired response 
.I D(f), 
and weighting function 
.I W(f),
the program finds the filter 
.I H(f)
which minimizes:
.nf
.ce
.if t \{
.EQ
int from -FS/2 to FS/2 ^{{left |^ D(f) - H(f) right | } sup 2 ~W(f)}~ df
.EN
\}
.if n \{
integral (from -FS/2 to FS/2) of |D(f)-H(f)|(squared) * W(f) df
\}
.fi
.PP
The user may specify the desired frequency response and the 
weighting function in one of two
modes: \fIband\fR and \fIpointwise\fR.
.PP
In "band mode" the program assumes that the desired frequency response and
the weighting function are constant throughout a number of frequency bands.
Bands are specified by parameters in the parameter file \fIparam_file\fR.
The parameters are sampling frequency, filter length, number of bands,
bandedges from 0 to half the sampling frequency in Hz, relative
gain in each band, and weighting value of each band.
.PP
In "pointwise mode" the program allows the desired frequency response 
and the weighting function to be arbitrarily shaped and specified at
a number of uniformly spaced points from zero to half the sampling frequency.
The number of points must be one plus a power of two.  The point values of
the desired response and the weighting function
are specified in the ascii files 
.I d_file
and
.I w_file
respectively.  
The first number in each of these files
should be an integer which tells how many point values are
in the file.  The point values follow.
Data in both files may be separated by any combination
of spaces or newlines.  The desired response and the weighting function may
be in the same file, in which case the desired response comes
first and the same file must be specified as both the
.I d_file
and the
.I w_file
above.
.PP
The band mode is more accurate than the point mode if the desired 
frequency response
and the weighting function are of the constant region form 
described above.
.PP
If the output file name \fIfeafilt_file\fR is "-", then standard output
is written.
.PP
Also see the shell script \fIxfir_filt(1-ESPS)\fR that is a cover
script for this and other FIR filter design program.
.sp
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file \fR[params]\fP"
uses the parameter file
.I param_file
rather than the default, which is \fIparams\fP.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
A value of 0 (the default value) will cause
.I wmse_filt
to do its work silently, unless there is an error.
A nonzero value will cause various parameters to be printed out
during program initialization.
.br
.TP
.BI \-n " filt_length"
The number of coefficients in the filter.  This option must be specified
in pointwise mode.  If this option is specified while in band mode, this
command-line option over-rides the parameter \fIfilt_length\fR in the
parameter file.
.br
.TP
.BI \-d " d_file"
The ascii file specifying the pointwise desired filter magnitude response.  The first
number in this file should be an integer, telling how many points
are in the file, which should be a power of two plus one.  Using this option
will place the user in pointwise mode, and the user must also specify a 
weighting function file using the
.B \-w 
option or he will be prompted for it.  
Points on the desired response may be negative in order to achieve
negative gain.  For best results, 
.I d_file
should contain a minimum of 513 or
.I filt_length
(whichever is larger) points.
.br
.TP
.BI \-w " w_file"
The ascii file containing the pointwise weighting function.  If the user is in 
the pointwise mode and does not specify 
.I w_file
he will be prompted for it.  If he specifies "\-" for 
.I w_file,
uniform weighting (i.e. everywhere equal to 1.0) will be used.
Weighting function point values may not be negative.
The first number in this file should be an integer telling how many
point values are in the file, which should be equal to the number of
desired response point values.
For best results, this file should contain
a minimum of 513 or
.I filt_length
(whichever is larger) points.
.sp
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The following ESPS parameters are supported in band mode.
.TP
.I samp_freq - float
Specifies the sampling frequency of the filter.
.TP
.I filt_length - int
Specifies the length of the filter, must be an odd number.
.TP
.I nbands - int
Specifies the number of bands.  For example, for a bandpass filter,
\fInbands\fR is \fI3\fR.
.TP
.I band_edge[i] - float
Specifies the \fIi\fRth bandedge in Hz.  There are \fInbands+1\fR
\fIband_edge[i]\fR parameters.  The first bandedge \fIband_edge1\fR must
start with 0, and the last bandedge must end with the Nyquist rate.
For example, for a bandpass filter with
sampling frequency of 8000 Hz, bandedges at 0, 2000, and 4000 Hz.
\fIBand_edge1\fR is 0, \fIband_edge2\fR is 2000, \fIband_edge3\fR is 4000.
.TP
.I band[i]_des - float
Specifies desired value for the \fIi\fRth band.  For example, for
a 3 band bandpass filter, \fIband1_des\fR is 0, \fIband2_des\fR is 1,
and \fIband3_des\fR is 0;
.TP
.I band[i]_wt - float
Specifies weighting value for the \fIi\fRth band.  For example, for
a 3 band bandpass filter with twice as much weight on the first band as
the other bands, \fIband1_wt\fR is 2, \fIband2_des\fR is 1, and 
\fIband3_des\fR is 2;
.sp
.SH ESPS COMMON
The common file is neither read nor written.
.SH ESPS HEADER
A new FEAFILT header is created for the output file.
The program fills in appropriate values in the common part of the header
as well as the following generic header items associated with the FEAFILT 
file type.
.sp

.I max_num
.IP
Set to
.I filt_length.
.sp

This value is set to BAND when in the band mode and POINT when in
the pointwise mode.
.sp

.sp

.sp
.IP
.I wts
.IP

and with the point weights when in the pointwise mode.
.PP
In addition, the generic header items \fIsamp_freq\fR (type DOUBLE)
and \fIdelay_samples\fP (type DOUBLE)
are added to the header. \fIDelay_samples\fP is equal to 
(\fIfilt_length\fP \- 1)/2.
This represents the delay to the center of the peak of the impulse response.
.sp
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The program will print an error message to standard error if the above specifications
are not met.
The error messages are intended to 
be self explanatory.
.sp
.SH FILES
When
.I debug_level
is nonzero, the program prints arrays to the files "harray", "warray", and
"hwarray" in the format used by printarr (3-ESPS).  These arrays are the time
domain values of the desired response, the weighting function, and the
convolution of these two responses, respectively.
