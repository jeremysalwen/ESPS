     This program is stored under the name _s_e_l_e_c_t and _e_s_e_l_e_c_t  in
     order  to avoid a name conflict with the _k_s_h builtin command
     _s_e_l_e_c_t.

     _S_e_l_e_c_t  applies  selection	 criteria  to  FEA  files.    The
     selected  records	may  be	 printed  and  may appended to an
     internal record buffer, which  in	turn  may  be  output  to
     another FEA file.	The selection criteria are specified as	a
     set of queries, with each query being  a  condition  on  the
     fields in the FEA record.

     _S_e_l_e_c_t operates in	two modes:  non-interactive and	 interac-
     tive.   The  non-interactive mode applies when the	----qqqq and ----oooo
     options are used.	In this	 case,	the  specified	query  is
     applied  to  all of the _i_n_p_u_t files and the selected records
     are written to _o_u_t_p_u_t.

     In	interactive mode (no ----qqqq	option), _s_e_l_e_c_t	prompts	the  user
     for  commands  (see below).  Alternatively, a file	of selec-
     tion commands can be used as standard input (e.g.,	_s_e_l_e_c_t	<
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d__f_i_l_e).   Command  files can also be invoked interac-
     tively.

     The following options are interpreted by _s_e_l_e_c_t:

     ----nnnn	   No source files or comments about queries are added to
	  the  headers of output files.	 Normally, the headers of
	  output files are expanded  to	 include  the  the  input
	  files	 as sources and	the selection queries as comments
	  in the _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e._c_o_m_m_e_n_t field.  The ----nnnn option	 disables
	  this	and  results in	faster operation, especially when
	  the output file already exists and is	large.

     ----cccc	   By default, comparisons involving  feature  fields  of
	  type	coded  are case	insensitive.   When the	----cccc option
	  is used, these comparisons are case sensitive.

     ----qqqq	_q_u_e_r_y
	  Apply	the _q_u_e_r_y  to  the  _i_n_p_u_t  files  and  write  the
	  selected records to _o_u_t_p_u_t (see ----oooo).

     ----eeee	_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
	  Execute the _e_v_a_l command on the input	 file  and  print
	  the  result  to standard output.   For details, see the
	  _e_v_a_l command below.

     ----ffff	_p_r_i_n_t_f _f_o_r_m_a_t _s_t_r_i_n_g
	  This option allows the specification of a _p_r_i_n_t_f format
	  string  to  be used to output	the values resulting from
	  use of the ----eeee	option.	 The  string  can  be  any  valid
	  _p_r_i_n_t_f  format  string,  except that only the	following
	  character escapes are	handled: \n, \t, \b, \r,  \f,  \\
	  (to  enter  a	slash),	and \' (to enter a single quote).
	  (Note	in particular, that \ddd is not	 handled.)   Keep
	  in  mind that	the value being	displayed is typed _d_o_u_b_l_e
	  inside of the	program.  So use of an incompatible  out-
	  put specification will result	in garbage dispplay.  For
	  example  the	following  option  might  be   used:   ----ffff
	  ''''VVVVaaaalllluuuueeee::::\\\\tttt%%%%eeee\\\\nnnn''''  or  ----ffff  AAAAnnnnyyyy  ssssttttrrrriiiinnnngggg:::: %%%%ffff uuuunnnniiiittttssss\\\\nnnn''''.   The
	  specification	string should contain at most one  output
	  format  control  appropriate for double values (%e, %f,
	  %g).

     ----oooo	_o_u_t_p_u_t
	  Specifies an output file.  This option must be used  if
	  the ----qqqq option	is used, and it	cannot be used unless one
	  or more input	files are specified on the command line.

     ----llll	_l_o_g
	  All user commands, together with  all	 terminal  output
	  from _s_e_l_e_c_t, will be recorded	on a file named	_l_o_g.

     Each command to _s_e_l_e_c_t consists of	one or two keywords  fol-
     lowed  by arguments.  The keywords	may be abbreviated.  Your
     unix interrupt character (_e._g. ^C)	will always terminate the
     current  command.	 Required  portions  of	 the keywords are
     shown in capital letters in the description below;	_s_e_l_e_c_t is
     not sensitive to case.  An	EOF is equivalent to a WWWWrrrriiiitttteeee fol-
     lowed by a	QQQQuuuuiiiitttt....

     Tagged and	segment	labelled input files involve some special
     handling  in  order  to make it possible to associate output
     records with the sampled  data  files  to	which  the  input
     records  refer.   If  the output file does	not exist, and if
     there is only one tagged input file, then the output file is
     also  tagged,  with  the  tags  being pointers into the same
     refer file	as specified in	the input file.	  If  the  output
     file  does	 not  exist,  and if there are two or more tagged
     input files, the output file is segment  labelled,	 and  all
     tagged  records  written to the output file are converted to
     segment labelled.	For the	case of	an existing output  file,
     see  the  note under BUGS below.  For more	information about
     taggged and segment labelled FEA files, see FEA (5-ESPS).

     @@@@_c_o_m_f_i_l_e
	  This command causes _s_e_l_e_c_t to	read  commands	from  the
	  file	_c_o_m_f_i_l_e	 ,  rather  than from the standard input.
	  When end-of-file is  reached,	 _s_e_l_e_c_t	 resumes  reading
	  from	the standard input.  Command files may be nested;
	  the maximum nesting depth is three.  Command files  are
	  aborted  (all	 remaining  commands  are  skipped) if an
	  error	or user	interrupt occurs while the  command  file
	  is being read.

     A _Q_U_E_R_Y consists of an expression,	which has  the	following
     form:

     <expr> ::=	<value>
	  | <field_name>{[<index>]}
	  | <character_string>
	  | $<external_function>
	  | <function> (<field_name>)
	  | <function> (<expr>)
	  | ( <expr> )
	  | <expr> <arith_op> <expr>
	  | <expr> <rel_op> <expr>
	  | - <expr>
	  | <expr>


     Here, <field_name>	is a FEA record	field name, <index> is an
     integer value indicating an offset	from the beginning of the
     field (used if the	field is not  a	 scaler),  <value>  is	a
     numerical value, <character_string> is a character	string in
     quotes ("), <function> is the name	of a  built  in	 function
     (see  FUNCTIONS),	<rel_op>  is  a	 relational operator, and
     <arith_op>	 is  a	arithmetic  operator   (defined	  below).
     <external_function>  is the name of an external program that
     is	called to implement some function on each  record.   This
     is	 described  in	detail below.  The "{}"	brackets indicate
     that  the	inclusion  of  field  index   is   optional.   If
     <field_name>   is	 not  a	 scaler	 field,	 <field_name>  is
     equivalent	to <field_name>[0] when	used in	an expression. An
     <external_function> is always preceded by a dollar	sign ($).

     If	a <field_name> is used in  an  expression  which  is  not
     defined in	the current input file,	then a warning is printed
     (once for each file) and zero is used as its  value.    This
     is	 not  a	fatal error, because there might be several input
     files open	that do	not have all of	the same fields.

     operations.

     The permitted arithmetic operators	are:
			 ____________________
			|     <arith_op>    |
			|_______________________________________|_
			| +   addition	    |
			| -   subtraction   |
			| *   multiplication|
			| /   division	    |
			|_^____e_x_p_o_n_e_n_t_i_a_t_i_o_n__|

     The ^ operator has	the highest precedence and is right asso-
     ciative.	The  / and * operators have the	next highest pre-
     cedence and are left associative.	The  +	and  -	operators
     have the lowest precedence	and are	also left associative.

     If	<value>	is a numerical value (appropriate if the type  of
     the  field	 is  a	numerical  type), it should be given in	a
     corresponding format for C	constants.  If the field type  is
     coded,  then  <value>  should  be	a quoted string	(upper or
     lower case) that is one of	the legal values.

     In	the case of coded field	types, the  default  behavior  is
     for  the comparison to be case insensitive.  Comparisons can
     be	made case sensitive by using the ----cccc option on the command
     line.

     There are three types of functions	supported by _s_e_l_e_c_t.  One
     type  of  function	 takes	as  its	domain a numerical value,
     which can be given	as any expression that	_s_e_l_e_c_t	can  pro-
     cess.   Another type of function operates on a <field_name>.
     The third type of function	is the <external_function>.  This
     form of function results in an external program being called

     to	perform	some function on each record.	This  provides	a
     very general capability, but since	the external program will
     be	called for each	record processed it is much  slower  than
     built in functions.

     The available built in function are:

     The only legal argument for functions on fields is	a  single
     <field_name>   without   an   index.    In	 this  case,  the
     <field_name> refers to the	entire field.

     If	<external_function> is	found  in  an  expression  _s_e_l_e_c_t
     searches  the  users  current  PATH  for  a program with the
     specified	name.	This  program  is  assumed  to	accept	a
     single-record ESPS	FEA file as its	only argument and to out-
     put a value (ASCII) on standard  output.  _S_e_l_e_c_t  creates	a
     single-record  ESPS file from each	record in the input files
     and calls <external_function> with	this file; the output  of
     <external_function>  is then used within the query. An exam-
     ple of the	source code for	an external function can be found
     in	 the  _s_e_l_e_c_t  source  directory,  or in	/usr/sps/lib on	a
     non-source	system.

     There are several built in	field  names  that  have  special
     meaning.  The are:

     The field name "tag" always refers	to the built in	tag field
     of	 the  record.	(See  the  discussion of tags and segment
     labelling under DESCRIPTION.)  The	name "REC" refers to  the
     record  number  (from  1)	of the record in the set of input
     files and the name	"FILE" refers  to  the	filename  of  the
     input file	in the set of input files.

     There are three types of expression errors.

     The first type are	 syntax	 errors	 caught	 by  the  parser.
     These  result result in a "syntax error" message followed by
     the offending character.	In the current release,	the query
     is	 usually  executed  anyway.   If the selected records are
     not wanted, they can be removed from  the	buffer	with  the
     UUUUNNNNDDDDOOOO command.  If the select is long (because the input file
     is	large) then  the  select  can  be  interrupted	and  then
     undone.   This will be improved in	a future release.

     The other type of expression errors relate	to the	execution
     of	 the  expression  itself.  These include use of	undefined
     fields, undefined functions, field	indexes	 out  of  bounds,
     arithmetic	 overflow  and	underflow,  and	 divide	 by zero.
     Errors that cannot	change from one	record or one input  file
     to	 the  next  are	considered fatal and terminate the SSSSEEEELLLLEEEECCCCTTTT
     (or EEEEVVVVAAAALLLL or SSSSHHHHOOOOWWWW SSSSEEEELLLLEEEECCCCTTTT).	This type of error is  caused  by
     trying  to	 call  an  undefined built in function or trouble
     running an	external function.

     The other errors described	above cause  the  termination  of
     the  expression  for  the current record.	In most	cases the
     expression	evaluates to zero.   In	 the  case  of	undefined
     field  and	 index	out  of	 bounds, zero is returned and the
     expression	continues.   In	the case of arithmetic	problems,
     the  expression  is  terminated and zero is returned for the
     expression.  The reason that these	errors are not	fatal  is
     that  several input files might be	open and they do not have
     to	all have the same fields.   A field might not be  defined
     for one file of the input set, but	might be defined for oth-
     ers.  Therefore, the query	should be allowed to process.	A
     message is	printed, once for each file, in	the case of these
     errors.   The  query  can	be  interrupted	 if  the  desired
     results will not be achieved.

     In	all cases a message is printed	stating	 what  action  is
     being taken when errors are found.

     The following paragraph describes the way _s_e_l_e_c_t will handle
     existing output files and input files with	tags:

     If	the output file	exists and is segment  labelled,  and  if
     there  is	one or more tagged input file, all tagged records
     written  to  the  output  file  are  converted  to	  segment
     labelled.	 If  the output	file exists and	is tagged, and if
     there is one or more tagged input file, the output	 file  is
     converted	from  tagged  to segment labelled, and all tagged
     records written to	the output file	are converted to  segment
     labelled.

     This is not done in this version.	 The pre-existing  output
     file  is  not changed, and	the tag	values copied into it may
     be	meaningless (because the _r_e_f_e_r file might be different.

     A syntax error in a query will terminate the  parse  of  the
     query  and	 it will then run.   After it runs you will get	a
     syntax error message.  If the select, selected records  that
     you don't want, use the "undo" command to undo the	effect of
     the most recent select operation.	Undo  can  only	 be  used
     once  after  each select.	You can't undo an undo (except to
     select again).

     If	referenced fieldname is	a complex feature field, then the
     real  part	 of that is used in the	expression.   Better sup-
     port for complex types will be added in the next version.
