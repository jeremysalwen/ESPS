.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Lloydcbk
designs a scalar quantization codebook (
.I outfile
) from training data
that is in an ascii file (
.I infile.
)
.I Infile 
must contain
only one floating number
per line.
The distortion measure (
.I distortion
),
the convergence threshold (
.I convergence
),
the identity of the codebook (
.I codebook_type
),
a description of the origin of the codebook (
.I description
),
and the number of codewords in the codebook (
.I codebook_size 
)
must be specified.
A summary of the design process can be saved by specifying a
.I history
file name,
the source(s) of the data can be saved by using
.I source_file
or 
.I source_list,
and a
particular element value can be identified by using
the 
.I element
flag.
.PP
If 
.I infile
is replaced by "\-",
standard input is read and used as training data by 
.I lloydcbk 
to design a codebook.
Similarly,
if 
.I outfile
is replaced by "\-",
the codebook is written to standard output.
.PP
Note that 
.B \-h, \-o, \-s, \-t, \-e
and 
.B \-S
are for recording keeping purposes only;
they do not affect the design of the codebook.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
The values of parameters obtained from the parameter file are printed
if the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE is 3 or greater.  The default
value is 3.
.PP
.I cbk_size 
(an integer),
.I convergence
(a float),
and
.I distortion
(a string)
may be specified in a 
.I params
file.
If any of these are specified on the command line,
the command line value over rides the 
.I params 
file value.
.SH ESPS COMMON
The common file is not accessed.
.SH ESPS HEADER
The header from each of the source files is
stored in the SCBK header.
.PP
The following values are written to the header of the SCBK file:
.I common.prog, common.vers, common.progdate, 
.I  hd.scbk->convergence, hd.scbk->num_cdwds, hd.scbk->num_items, 
.I hd.scbk->codebook_type, hd.scbk->element_num,
and
.I hd.scbk->distortion.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
.I debug_levels
greater than 0 cause messages to be printed. The higher the 
.I debug_level
the greater the detail of the debug information.
The default level is zero, which causes no debug output.
.TP
.BI \-P " params_file"
Use the ESPS parameter file 
.I params_file
rather than the default parameter file,
which is 
.I params.
.TP
.BI \-n " codebook_size"
Specifies the number of codewords in the codebook.
It must be a positive number.
.TP 
.BI \-c " convergence"
Convergence threshold (floating value) to use at each level of clustering.
When 
{1 - [(new total distortion)/(old total distortion)]}
is less than 
.I convergence,
the clustering stops. If the current number of codewords is equal
to 
.I codebook_size,
.I lloydcbk 
is done, otherwise 
.I lloydcbk 
splits the current codewords and starts a new improvement loop.
Reasonable convergence values are data dependent,
but .001 is often reasonable.
.TP
.BI \-h " history"
If a file name is specified, 
.I lloydcbk 
writes to it information about each iteration of clustering.
.TP 
.BI \-o " description"
A description of the method used to generate the training
data is written here and stored in the TYP_TEXT field of the output file
header. If the 
.B \-o 
option is not specified,
.I lloydcbk
prompts the user for a description.
The maximum length of this string is 32768
characters. (Not supported yet)
.TP 
.BI \-s " source"
The name of the ESPS file from which the training data was derived.
Multiple sources may be specified by specifying them individually
with separate 
.B \-s 
flags. The header of each source file is added to the codebook file's header.
(Not supported yet)
.TP
.BI \-d " distortion"
The distortion measure used in the clustering.
Currently,
only SQUARED_ERROR is supported.
.TP
.BI \-t " codebook_type"
The name of the parameter, such as reflection coefficient, pulse power, etc.,
that the codebook represents.
Legal values are defined in <esps/header.h>, and they include
RC_VCD_CBK= voiced reflection coefficients, RC_UNVCD_CBK = unvoiced 
reflection coefficients, 
RC_CBK = reflection coefficients, PP_CBK = pulse powers, 
PD_CBK = pulse durations,
FL_CBK = frame lengths, 
EP_CBK = lpc error powers, PPR_CBK = pulse power ratios,
PPD_CBK = pulse power differences, PDD_CBK = pulse duration differences, 
LAR_UNVCD_CBK = unvoiced log area ratios, LAR_VCD_CBK 
= voiced log area ratios,
and LAR_CBK = log area ratios.
.TP
.BI \-e " element"
The element of the
.I codebook_type
that is being processed.
Legal values are integers greater than or equal to zero, and two negative 
values that have special meaning.
\-1 means all elements of the specified 
.I codebook_type
are used, and \-2 means
that no record of element value is being kept.
For 
.I codebook_type's
that imply two adjacent elements, such as PPR,
the element value is the first of the two adjacent elements.
.TP
.BI \-S " source_list"
An ascii file that lists all the sources of the input data may be specified.
This file contains one source file per line.
.I Lloydcbk
opens this file, reads each source name,
opens that file,
and copies the header into the output SCBK file. (Not supported yet)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
A fatal error occurs if the specified source file does not exist, or 
if it is not an ESPS
file.
.SH EXPECTED CHANGES
.PP
Additional distortion measures will be added.

options are not yet supported.
