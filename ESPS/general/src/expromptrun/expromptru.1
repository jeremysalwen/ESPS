.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIExpromptrun\fP is an X Windows program that displays an interactive
form for entering ESPS parameters, and then runs the corresponding
ESPS program.  It is closely related to \fIexprompt\fP
(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1), which just prompts for parameters and produces a
parameter file for subsequent use.
.PP
It is assumed that \fIcommand_line\fP is a full command line for 
an ESPS program (including command line options and file names), 
with the exception that the standard ESPS \fB-P\fP option is \fInot\fP
included.  A suitable \fB-P\fP option will be inserted by
\fIexpromptrun\fP.  
.PP
\fIExpromptrun\fR processes the ESPS parameter file \fIparam_file \fP
and (optionally) ESPS Common.  It then pops up a window containing an
entry for each of the indefinite parameters in \fIparam_file\fP
(parameters with values assigned using the "?=" operator).  Each such
entry has the name of the parameter and a space for filling in the
desired value.  Default values from the parameter file are filled in
initially.  If a prompt string was included in the parameter file, the
string is displayed above the corresponding parameter entry.
.PP
If the parameter definition in \fIparam_file\fP includes the
optional set of discrete choices, the window entry for the parameter
contains a set of screen buttons, one for each choice \- the user
selects the parameter value by clicking with the mouse on the desired
choice.  If discrete choices were not provided in the parameter file,
the window entry for the parameter contains space in which the user
can type the desired value.
.PP
Before displaying the interactive window, \fIexpromptrun\fP creates a
temporary parameter file to record the user's parameter entries; this
temporary parameter file will be used subsequently in running
\fIcommand_line\fP.  If the environment variable ESPS_TEMP_PATH is
defined, it will be used as the location for the temporary parameter
file.  Otherwise, a compiled in default (usually /usr/tmp) will be
used.  When \fIexpromptrun\fP first creates the temporary parameter
file, it fills it with definitions for all of the parameters in
\fIparam_file\fP and ESPS Common (if Common is processed).  The
initial values are the default values from \fIparam_file\fP, perhaps
modified by Common processing.
.PP
Whenever the user enters a valid new value for a parameter in the
\fIexpromptrun\fP window, the temporary parameter file is updated.
Note that that data entry requires that a RETURN by typed at the end
of the entry string. Input parameters are checked for data type
format.  If limits are provided for numeric parameters in the
parameter file, the limits are checked.
.PP
Two or three screen buttons are provided in a panel at the top of the 
\fIexpromptrun\fP window.  The button DEFAULTS reverts all parameter
values to the defaults that were in the \fIparam_file\fP (as updated by
Common).  The button DONE causes \fIexpromptrun\fP to exit.  Use this when
you have finished entering values.  The state of the temporary output parameter
file will correspond to the state of the window when DONE is selected
(assuming that RETURNs have been typed as appropriate).  
.PP
If the \fB\-h\fP option was used, a HELP button is also provided in
the parameter prompting window.  Selecting it causes a help file to be
displayed in a text window.  If the \fIhelp_name\fP specified with
\fB\-h\fP has a leading "." or "/", it is interpreted as the path to a
pure ASCII file containing help information.  If there is no leading
"." or "/", \fIhelp_name\fP is interpreted as the name of an ESPS
program for which the parameters are intended.  In this case, HELP
presents a copy of the corresponding ESPS manual page in a text
window.  (To obtain it, \fIeman\fP is run and the output is stripped
of format control strings.)  In both cases, the text window includes a
FIND button to facilitate string searching.
.PP
After the user exits the parameter prompt window (by clicking on 
DONE), \fIexpromptrun\fP builds a new command line from
\fIcommand_line\fP by inserting a \fB-P\fP after the first 
item in \fIcommand_line\fP (which is assumed to be a program name).  
The temporary parameter file created by \fIexpromptrun\fP is used 
as the argument for the new \fB-P\fP option.  The new command line 
is then executed via \fIsystem\fP(3).  When \fIexpromptrun\fP
terminates in this case, the exit status is that of the command 
run.  
.PP
Note that \fIexpromptrun\fP does not terminate until after the 
command generated from \fIcommand_line\fP has completed running.  This
makes \fIexpromptrun\fP more useful in scripts and as a command tied to
\fIxwaves\fP+ menus.  The temporary parameter file is deleted before 
a normal exit from \fIexpromptrun\fP.  
.PP
If the temporary file was not created properly, \fIexpromptrun\fP
exits without attempting to run the \fIcommand_line\fP.  In this case,
if there was trouble processing the input parameter file,
\fIexpromptrun\fP exits with status 1.  If the user exits via the
"DONE" button but the parameters were not written successfully,
\fIexpromptrun\fP exits with status 2.  If the parameter prompt window
exits for other reasons, the exit status is 3; the most common reasons
are inability to create a window in the first place, a window-manager
quit operation, or an explicit kill signal.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file" " \fR[params]\fP"
Specifies the name of the ESPS parameter file to process.  If you want
to force the parameter to come only from ESPS common, use "\fB\-P\fP
/dev/null".  
.TP
.BI \-n 
Do not process ESPS Common (i.e., always get the parameter value from
the file specified by the \fB\-P\fP option).  (Within \fIexpromptrun\fP, the
effect of \fB\-n\fP is to have \fIread_params\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)
called with the SC_NOCOMMON flag.)  Note also that Common processing 
can also be disabled by setting the unix environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  It is an error to specify both \fB\-n\fP and
\fB\-c\fP.  
.TP
.BI \-c " checkfile"
If the ESPS Common file exists, this option specifies that the Common
file should be processed only if the \fIcheckfile\fP matches the value
of the \fIfilename\fP in the Common file.  This option will have no
effect if the unix environment variable USE_ESPS_COMMON is "off".  It
is an error to specify both \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-c\fP.
.TP
.BI \-h " help_name"
Causes a HELP button to be provided in the \fIexpromptrun\fP window.
Selecting this button brings up a help file in a text window.  If
\fIhelp_name\fP has a leading "." or "/", it is interpreted as the
path to a pure ASCII file containing help information.  If there is no
leading "." or "/", \fIhelp_name\fP is interpreted as the name of an
ESPS program for which the parameters are intended.  In this case,
HELP presents a copy of the corresponding ESPS manual page in a text
window.  (To obtain it, \fIeman\fP is run and the output is stripped
of format control strings.)  In both cases, the text window includes a
FIND button to facilitate string searching.
.TP
.B \-z
Specifies that \fIexpromptrun\fP operate silently; conditions such as 
"no parameters" or "no indefinite parameters" are not reported. 
.TP 
.BI \-X " x_pos"
Specifies the x-position (in the root window) of the frame displayed
by \fIexpromptrun\fP.  Both \fIx_pos\fP and \fIy_pos\fP must be specified
and be non-negative; otherwise, the positioning will be left up to the
window manager.  The standard XView \fB-Wp\fP and standard X11
\fB-geometry\fP options can also be used to position the window.  
.TP 
.BI \-Y " y_pos"
Specifies the y-position (in the root window) of the frame displayed
by \fIexpromptrun\fP.  Both \fIx_pos\fP and \fIy_pos\fP must be specified
and be non-negative; otherwise, the positioning will be left up to the
window manager.  The standard XView \fB-Wp\fP and standard X11
\fB-geometry\fP options can also be used to position the window.  
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If \fIdebug_level\fP is positive,
.I expromptrun
outputs debugging messages. The messages proliferate as 
.I debug_level 
increases.  For level 0, there is no output.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The ESPS parameter file specified by the \fB\-P\fP option is processed
only to obtain parameter specifications.  In this respect,
\fIxpromptrun\fP is quite different from most other ESPS programs,
which use the parameter file to pass parameter values that control the
operation of the program.
.SH ESPS HEADERS
.PP
No ESPS files are processed by \fIexpromptrun\fP.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
Parameter processing by \fIexpromptrun\fP follows standard ESPS
conventions: Unless the parameter value is overridden by the value in
ESPS Common, the default value displayed by \fIexpromptrun\fP is the value
from the parameter file \fIparam_file\fP.  This default value will be
overridden by the value in Common (if the Common file exists and
contains a value for the parameter), provided that ESPS Common
processing is enabled and that the Common file is younger than the
parameter file.  If a \fIcheckfile\fP is specified by means of the
\fB\-c\fP option, the parameter file value for \fIparam_name\fP will be
overridden by the value in Common only if \fIcheckfile\fP is identical
to the \fIfilename\fP entry in the Common file.
.PP
ESPS Common processing is enabled unless the unix environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON is "off" or the \fB\-n\fP is specified.  The default
ESPS Common file is .espscom in the user's home directory.  This may
be overridden by setting the environment variable ESPSCOM to the
desired path.  User feedback from parameter and Common file processing
(by the library \fIread_params\fP and \fIgetsym\fP functions) is
determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no
feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly detailed feedback.
If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is assumed.
.PP
It is an error to give both \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-c\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
This computes a spectrogram after prompting for all parameters but 
\fIstart\fP and \fInan\fP:

.PP
Array parameters (float and int arrays) are not supported yet.  
.PP
Vertical and horizontal scrollbars are provided (their use may be
necessary in the case of large parameter files).  Owing to bugs in the
current version of the xview library, however, their behavior is not 
reliable.  For example, joining a split vertical scrollbar can cause 
a core dump.
