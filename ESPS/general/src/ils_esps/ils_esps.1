.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program
.I ils_esps
takes the ILS sampled data file
.I in_file
and produces the ESPS  sampled data file
.I out_file 
(FEA_SD).
The data is scaled by the factor 
.I scale
and printed to the output file in the data format specified by
.I type.
If
.I in_file
is "\-" then the standard input is read.  If
.I out_file
is "\-" or left off, the program writes to standard output.
.PP
Prior to any processing, the program checks the ILS file type code
to determine whether the file was produced on another machine that
requires byte swapping.
The byte swapping is performed on the file during processing if
necessary.
If the appropriate file type code is not produced
by swapping the type code in the ILS header, an error message is printed to
.I stderr
and the program exits.
\fIIls_esps\fR assumes that the header data is written in long (32 bit) 
format and that the data is written in short (16 bit) format.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
A value of 0 (the default value) will cause
.I ils_esps
to do its work silently, unless there is an error.
A nonzero value will cause various parameters to be printed out
during program initialization.
.br
.TP
.BI \-r " range"
.BI \-p " range"
Selects a subrange of points to be converted, where the start and end
points are defined with respect to the original input ILS file.
The range is specified using the format 
.I start\-end
or
.IR start:end .
Either 
.I start
or 
.I end
may be omitted, in which case the omitted parameter defaults respectively
to the start or end of the input ILS file.  
The form 
.I start:+number
and
.I start-+number
are supported also. They are both equivalent to
.I start:start + number.
If the range runs past the end of the file, the program prints
an error message to the standard error and exits.
\fBp\fP and \fBr\fP are synonyms.
.TP
.BI \-g " scale"
The integers in the ILS file are multiplied by
.I scale
before printing to the output file.
The default value for 
.I scale
is 1.0.
.br
.TP
.BI \-h " size" " \fR[128]\fP"
Specifies the number of items (longs) in the ILS header.
.br
.TP
.BI \-d " type"
The data is printed to the ESPS sampled data file in
.I type
format.  
Choices for 
.I type
are 'd' for doubles, 'f' for floats, 'l' for longs, and 's' for shorts.
The default for 
.I type
is 'f'.
.br
.TP
.BI \-q " equip"
The specified equipment code is entered in the header of the output file.
Choices for the character string
.I equip
are "ef12m", "ad12f", "dsc", "lpa11", and "none".  The default for
.I equip
is "dsc".
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The parameter file is not accessed.
.SH ESPS COMMON
The Common file is not accessed.
.SH ESPS HEADER
A new header is created for the output file.
The program stores the source file name in the ESPS header
but does not store a source file header.
Other appropriate header items such as
.I src_sf,
.I sf,
and
.I equip
are also stored in the ESPS header.
.SH WARNINGS
Mu law compressed data is not handled by this program.
ILS files with 16 bit header items are not handled by this
program.
.SH BUGS
.PP
None known.
