.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Btosps
converts a headerless binary sampled data file into an ESPS FEA_SD
file.  The input data can be of any ESPS supported data type (DOUBLE,
FLOAT, LONG, SHORT, BYTE, DOUBLE_CPLX, FLOAT_CPLX, LONG_CPLX,
SHORT_CPLX, BYTE_CPLX); multi-channel data are supported.  
.PP
If the first argument is "\-",
.I btosps
will read from the standard input.
If the second argument is "\-",
it will write to the standard output.  
.PP
Use \fIaddfeahd\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) for more general conversions to
FEA files. 
.PP
For record-keeping purposes, \fIbtosps\fP stores an ASCII comment in
the header of of the output file.  The comment should describe the
origins of the data.  If a comment is not supplied in the parameter
file or by means of the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-C\fR options, the user is
prompted for one.  If \fIinfile\fP is standard input, the comment must
be supplied directly as the user cannot be prompted.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file \fR[params]\fP"
The name of the ESPS parameter file.   
.TP
.BI \-f " sampling_rate \fR[8000]\fP"
The sampling rate \- the value is stored in the generic header item
\fIrecord_freq\fP in the output file.  
.TP
.BI \-T " start_time \fR[0]\fP"
The starting time of the data \- the value is stored in the generic
item \fIstart_time\fP.
.TP
.BI \-n " nchan \fR[1]\fP"
The number of data channels.  The data are assumed to be stored in the
same order as in an ESPS FEA_SD file, i.e., the first sample from all
channels, followed by the second sample from all channels, etc.
The dimension of the output field "samples" is \fInchan\fP.  
.TP
.BI \-S " skip_bytes"
This many bytes will be skipped at the beginning of the input file.
If only a section of the raw input file is to be converted, the
\s-1UNIX\s+1 \fIdd\fR program can be used to pre-process the raw data
file.  This option is normally used to skip over an existing non-ESPS
file header.
.TP
.B \-F
If this option is used, then the \fB-S\fR option described above must
also be used.   
This option causes the data skipped at the beginning of the file to be
saved in the output ESPS file, as a \fIforeign header\fR.   Two generic
header items are created in the output file; \fIforeign_hd_length\fR and
\fIforeign_hd_ptr\fR.   The item \fIforeign_hd_length\fR is given the
value of the \fB-S\fR option; i.e. the number of bytes to skip.  The
item \fIforeign_hd_ptr\fR is set to the in memory address of this block
of data after it is read from the input file.   This is used by
\fIwrite_header\fR(3\-ESPS) to save this information in the ESPS file.
The intention here, is to allow a non-ESPS header that might already be
on a file, to be preserved as the file is converted to ESPS.
On the ESPS file, the foreign header is physically
located between the ESPS header and the data records.   
The program \fIbhd\fR(1\-ESPS) can be used to remove the ESPS header and
leave the original foreign header.
Also see
\fIread_header\fR(3\-ESPS) and \fIwrite_header\fR(3\-ESPS).
.sp
Note that the machine independent file I/O cannot operate on foreign
headers (since we have no way of knowing the internal structure). 
If an ESPS file containing a foreign header is moved to a machine of a
different data format than the one on which it was created, the foreign
header will not be translated as the ESPS header and data is.
.sp
A user written program can use the value of the generic
\fIforeign_hd_ptr\fR in order to access any information that is in the
foreign header.   The type of this generic is \fBlong\fR, so it must be
cast to a \fB(char *)\fR and then it can be used to address into the
foreign header.
.TP
.BI \-c " comment"
Specifies that the ASCII string 
.I comment
be added as a comment in the header of the output file.  
.TP
.BI \-C " comment_file"
Specifies that the contents of the file
.I comment_file
be added as a comment in the header of the output file.
.TP
.B \-E
By default, the input file is assumed to be in the machine's native data
representation.   If this option is used, the input is taken to be in
ESPS EDR representation.   This would be the case, for example, if the input
file was an ESPS that was processed with \fIbhd\fR on a system that
produced EDR format files.   Regardless of the format of the input file,
the output file format is controlled by the \fBESPS_EDR\fR environment
variable, as are all programs which produce ESPS files.  If the Unix
environment variable \fBESPS_EDR\fR has the value of \fIon\fR, then the
output file is in Entropic's external data representation and can be
read by any ESPS implementation on any supported machine.  If this
variable is not defined, then the output file is in the machine's native
format.  This format can be read by some ESPS implementations, but not
all.
.TP
.BI \-t " data_type \fR[short]\fP"
Specifies the numberic type of the data in \fIinfile\fP.  Possible
values are DOUBLE, FLOAT, LONG, SHORT, BYTE, DOUBLE_CPLX, FLOAT_CPLX,
LONG_CPLX, SHORT_CPLX, BYTE_CPLX.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
For \fIdebug_level\fP values greater than 0, various debugging
messages are printed.  The higher the value of \fIdebug_level\fP, the
more verbose the messages.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
The following values are read from the parameter file if they exist.
Command line options override the parameter file values.:
.IP
.I "sampling_rate - float"
.IP
The data sampling rate, stored in the generic header item
\fIrecord_freq\fP.  Default is 8000 Hz.  
.IP
.I "nchan - int"
.IP
The number of data channels.  Default value is 1.  
.IP
.I "start_time - float"
.IP
The starting time of the converted data.  Default is 0.  
.IP
.I "data_type - string"
.IP
The data_type of the input data; possible values are DOUBLE, FLOAT,
LONG, SHORT, BYTE, DOUBLE_CPLX, FLOAT_CPLX, LONG_CPLX, SHORT_CPLX,
BYTE_CPLX.
.IP
.I "skip_bytes - int"
.IP
The number of bytes to skip at the beginning of the input file.
Default is 0.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is not read by \fIbtosps\fP.  The following items are
written into the ESPS Common file if the output is not standard
output:
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The starting point, always 1 in this case.
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The number of points in the output file.
.sp
.I "prog - string"
.IP
This is the name of the program (\fIbtosps\fP in this case).
.sp
.I "filename - string"
.IP
The name of the output ESPS file. 
.PP
These items are not written to ESPS COMMON if the output file is <stdout>.
.SH ESPS HEADER
.PP
The universal part of the header if filled in in the usual way.  The
generic \fIrecord_freq\fP is filled in with the sampling rate, and the
item \fIstart_time\fP is filled in with the starting time.  If the
output is not standard output,
the generic header item \fImax_value\fP is filled in with the
maximum absolute value of the data in the file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.I Btosps
informs the user and quits if the input file does not exist.
.I Btosps
informs the user and quits if no comment is supplied and if the user
cannot be prompted for one.
.SH BUGS
.PP
None known.
