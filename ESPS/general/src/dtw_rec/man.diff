.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIDtw_rec\fP compares test sequences to reference sequences using a dynamic
time warping algorithm (see \fIdtw\fP (3-ESPS)).  
Comparisons can be made between sequences of floating point vectors
or sequences of codeword indices.  
.PP
\fIDtw_rec\fP reads a list of FEA file names from the the ASCII 
file \fIreference_list\fP.  Sequences are read from these files to form a
database of reference sequences. 
\fIDtw_rec\fP then reads the ASCII file \fItest\fP which contains names of
FEA files which contain test sequences. A test sequence is read from each
of these files and 
compared to every reference sequence.
For each test sequence, the identity of the closest reference sequence is written 
to the ASCII file \fIresults\fP.  \fIDtw\fP attempts to read the CHAR generic header item
\fIsequence_id\fP from the FEA files named in \fIreference_list\fP and 
\fItest_list\fP to identify each of the sequences.  If this field is not present,
the sequences are identified by the name of the file from which they were read.
The tasks performed by \fIdtw_rec\fP can also
be done using \fIdtw\fP within a shell script, but \fIdtw_rec\fP 
avoids repeatedly opening and closing reference files.
.PP
The ASCII file \fIresults\fP contains entries for each test
sequence.  Each entry contains the identity of a test sequence, the 
identity of a reference sequence,
and the distance between the two found by the time warping algorithm.
The parameter \fIbest_list_length\fP is the number of entries 
for each test sequence.  For the default value of
1, \fIresults\fP contains a single entry for each test sequence,
which identifies the closest reference utterance to the test sequence and gives
the DTW distance between the two sequences.  If \fIbest_list_length\fP is 
specified, this information is written for the \fIbest_list_length\fP
closest reference sequences to each test sequence.
.PP
The parameter \fIdelta\fP specifies the range of points in the reference
sequence which may be aligned with the initial and final points of the test
sequence.  For \fIdelta\fP = 0 (default), the algorithm forces the
initial and final points of the test and reference sequences to be aligned.
.PP
The files \fIreference_list\fP, \fItest_list\fP, and \fIresults\fP 
must be provided.  For \fIresults\fP, "-" can be used to specify that 
results be written to standard output, but standard input cannot be
used for the other files.
.PP
\fBUSAGE EXAMPLE\fP
.br
The following shell script contains an example of using \fIdtw_rec\fP
for a vector quantizer recognition task.  The directory
\fIref_data\fP contains FEA reference files, each of which contains 
a reference
sequence in the field \fBre_spec_val\fP, which has dimension 512.
The test sequences are 
in FEA files in the directory \fItest_data\fP.  These sequences must
also be in the field \fBre_spec_val\fP.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param"
Uses the parameter file \fIparam\fP, rather than the default, which is \fIparams\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " sequence_field" 
Name of the FEA field from which test and
reference sequences are read.  If \fB\-c\fP option is specified, the field
must contain a single integer of type LONG; the default field name is then
\fIspec_param_cwndx\fP and the routine \fIdtw_tl\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) is used.  
If \fB\-c\fP is not specified, the field
must be data type FLOAT and have the same number of elements in
each file; the default field name is then \fIspec_param\fP and the routine 
\fIdtw_l2\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) is used.
.TP
.BI \-c " distance_table_file"
The FEA_VQ file \fIdistance_table_file\fP
should contain a two dimensional, 
square, field \fIdistance_table_field\fP of data type DOUBLE.
This field is read from record \fIdistance_recno\fP to form a 
\fBdim\fP x \fBdim\fP array of distances,
where the  value \fBdim\fP is taken from the FEA_VQ defined item 
\fIcurrent_size\fP in the same record.
The dimension \fBdim\fP is used to check the labels read from
the field \fIsequence_field\fP.  If the labels fall outside the
range [0,\fBdim\fP-1], \fIdtw\fP warns and exits.  The file
\fIdistance_table_file\fP can be created from a FEA_VQ codebook file 
using \fIcbkd\fP (1-ESPS).  
.TP
.BI \-t " distance_table_field"
If the \fB-c\fP option is specified, the table of distances is read
from field \fIdistance_table_field\fP in record \fIdistance_recno\fP of
file \fIdistance_table_file\fP.  The default name of the file read is 
"distance_table". 
.TP
.BI \-r " distance_table_recno"
If the \fB-c\fP option is specified, the table of distances is read
from field \fIdistance_table_field\fP in record 
\fIdistance_table_recno\fP of file \fIdistance_table_file\fP.  
By default, the last record of \fIdistance_table_file\fP is read.
.TP
.BI \-b " "
If set, \fIdtw_rec\fP keeps track of the least distance between each test
sequence and all the reference sequences.  If this distance is exceeded during
the comparison of a test and reference sequence, the comparison halts, and 
comparison to the next reference sequence begins.  This can speed computation. 
.TP
.BI \-d " delta"
If set, the comparison algorithm may ignore the first and last 
\fIdelta\fP vectors in the reference sequence when finding the closest
distance to the test sequence.  For a full explanation,
see \fIdtw\fP (3-ESPS).  The default is 0, which requires that the 
endpoints be compared to each other.
.TP
.BI \-l " best_list_length"
Number of entries in \fIresults\fP for each test sequence. The default 
is 1. By default, only the identity of the closest reference sequence
and the corresponding distance is written to \fIresults\fP for each
test sequence.  If the \fB\-l\fP option is used, this information is
written to \fIresults\fP for the \fBbest_list_length\fP closest reference
sequences.
The \fB\-b\fP and \fB\-l\fP options cannot be used simultaneously.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
A positive value causes debugging output to be printed on the standard
error output. Larger values give more output.  The default is 0, for
no output.
.sp
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
The parameter file is not required to be present; there are default
values which will apply.  If the parameter file does exist, the following
parameters are read:
.TP
.I sequence_field
.IP
Name of field from which test and reference sequences are read.  This
parameter is not read if the \fB\-f\fP option is used.
.TP
.I distance_table_file
.IP
Name of FEA_VQ file from which distance table is read to perform dynamic
time warping comparison between sequences of indices.  This parameter is
not read if the \fB\-c\fP option is used.  If this parameter is used, 
\fIdtw_rec\fP
acts as if the file name was obtained with the \fB\-c\fP option; see
the \fB\-c\fP option description.
.TP
.I distance_table_field
.IP
If either the \fB\f-c\fP option or the \fIdistance_table_file\fP
parameter is used, the distance table is read from the field
\fIdistance_table_field\fP.  This parameter is not read if the
\fB\-t\fP option is used.
.TP
.I distance_table_recno
.IP
If either the \fB\-c\fP option or the \fIdistance_table_file\fP
parameter is used, the distance table is read from record
\fIdistance_table_recno\fP of the specified file.  This parameter is not
read if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.
.TP
.I best_so_far 
.IP
If set to 1, this \fIdtw_rec\fP behaves as if the \fB\-b\fP option is 
used. This parameter is not read if the \fB\-b\fP option is used.
.TP
.I delta
.IP
Allows the comparison algorithm to ignore the first and last \fIdelta\fP
points in the reference sequence in finding the closest distance to the
test sequence. See the description of the \fB\-d\fP option.
This parameter is not read if the \fB\-d\fP option is used.
.TP 
.I best_list_length
.IP
Number of entries in \fIresults\fP for each test sequence.
See the description of the \fB\-l\fP option.
This parameter is not read if the \fB\-l\fP option is used.
.TP
.I debug_level
.IP
A positive value causes debugging output to be printed on the standard
error output. Larger values give more output.  This parameter is not read
if the \fB\-x\fP option is used.
.sp
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
ESPS Common is not read or written.
.sp
.SH ESPS HEADER
The file \fIresults\fP is an ASCII file and has no ESPS header.

.sp
.SH COMMENTS
\fIDtw_rec\fP uses the routine \fIfree_header\fP (3-ESPS) when 
reading reference and test sequences.  This avoids consuming and
not freeing 
memory when reading FEA headers using the routine 
\fIeopen\fP (3-ESPS). There are instances when \fIfree_header\fP 
should not be used, e.g. \fIeopen\fP reads an SD(5-ESPS) file  and
returns an FEA_SD(5-ESPS) header.  This should not be a problem here.
