.I file.fea
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I plotfield
plots a named field from an ESPS FEA
.I file.fea. 
Fields containing complex data are not supported yet.
If
.I file.fea
is "\-", the standard input is read.
.PP
The plot is displayed in an X window.  The display has three pull down
menus: \fBFile\fR, \fBViews\fR, and \fBHelp\fR.    
See \fIplotsd(1-ESPS)\fP for a description of these menus.
.PP
If the \fB\-r\fP option is omitted, then the named 
.I field
is plotted from just the first record of 
.I file.fea. 
Use \fB\-r1:\fP to plot the data
for the entire file.
.PP
.I Plotfield
finds the maximum and  minimum values of the points to be 
plotted and computes appropriate scales for the 
.IR x -
and 
.IR y -axes.
These automatic values for the y-axis can be overriden by the 
.B \-y
or
.B \-Y 
options.  
.PP
The fieldname to plot must be given with the 
.B \-f
flag.  This is not optional and there is no default.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-r " record"
.TP
.BI \-r " first:last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first:+incr
Determines the records from which the named \fIfield\fP is plotted.  In
the first form, a single integer identifies one record from which 
.I field 
is plotted.  The \fIx\fP\-axis shows element number within the field and 
the \fIy\fP\-axis shows element value.  
.IP
In the second form, a pair of unsigned integers gives the first and last
points of the range.  If
.I first
is omitted, 1 is used.  If 
.I last 
is omitted, the last record in 
.I file.fea
is assumed.  The third form is equivalent to the first with
.I "last = first + incr."
When more than one record is plotted, the element values are catenated
together before plotting with the \fIx\fP\-axis showing the cumulative 
element number.  (For example, if \fIfield\fP has ten elements and 
two records are plotted, the \fIx\fP\-axis will be labelled 1\-20).  
.TP
.BI \-t " text"
A line of text to be printed below the plot.  
By default, \fIplotfield\fP prints a line giving the fieldname, 
record number, and file name.  An additional line may 
be printed via the 
.B \-t
option.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
If
.I debug_level
is nonzero, debugging information is written to the standard error output.
Default is 0 (no debugging output).
.TP
.BI \-y " low:high"
Specifies approximate lower and upper limits for the 
.IR y -axis.
The values are adjusted by 
.I plotfield
in an attempt to make an esthetically pleasing plot.  See also 
the \fB\-Y\fP option.  If neither \fB\-y\fP or \fB\-Y\fP is 
specified, limits are calculated automatically.  
.TP
.BI \-Y " low:high"
Specifies exact lower and upper limits for the 
.IR y -axis.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
\fBplotfield \-f spec_param \fB\-r5\fR speech.fana\fP
.PP
plots the \fIspec_param\fR field from record 5 of speech.fana.  
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
No ESPS parameter file is read.
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
ESPS Common processing is disabled.  
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.I Plotfield
complains and exits if 
.I file.fea
does not exist or is not a FEA file.
It also exits if the named field contains complex data.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION NOTE"
.PP
The current version of \fIfieldplot\fP is implemented as a shell script
that pipes the output of \fIpplain\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) through
\fItestsd\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) and \fIplotsd\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).  This is
an example of how ESPS programs can be combined with the "Unix tools
approach" \- see the simplified example on the \fIpplain\fP
(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) man page.
.SH EXPECTED CHANGES
.PP
None contemplated.
