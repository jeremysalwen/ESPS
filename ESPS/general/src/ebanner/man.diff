.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIEbanner\fP converts ASCII text into a sampled data waveform whose
wide-band spectrogram image shows the ASCII text in the form of
raster-graphics fonts.  The characters are represented as a matrix of
dots \- some on and some off.  For each "on" dot, a wavelet with the
correct location in the time-frequency plane is generated.  All of
these wavelets are then summed to produce the output.
.PP
The intput file \fIinput.text\fP is a text file, and the output file
\fIoutput.sd\fP an ESPS sampled data (FEA_SD) file of data type float.
Standard input and standard output are not supported.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-f " font \fR[$ESPS_BASE/lib/fixedwidthfonts/cour.r.24]\fP"
The spectral-domain image is rendered using (Sunview) fixed width
fonts.  If \fIfont\fP is a full path to a file, that file is used as
the font.  Otherwise, \fIebanner\fP searches for the font first
relative to the current directory and then relative to
$ESPS_BASE/lib/fixedwidthfonts.  This search path is overriden by the
contents of the Unix environment variable EBANNER_FONTS, if it is
defined.
.TP
.BI \-l " low \fR[.1]\fP"
.TP
.BI \-h " high \fR[.9]\fP"
The \-\fBl\fP and \-\fBh\fP options specify the lower and upper
frequency bounds of the top and bottom of the text display in terms of
fractions of the Nyquist rate.  Thus, for a sample frequency of 16kHz,
"\-\fBl\fP .2" means that the bottom of the descenders will be at
1600Hz on the spectrogram.  These options permit positioning a string of text
anywhere in the frequency range.  It's then a simple matter of adding
two (or more) such signals together with \fIaddsd\fP (1-ESPS) in order 
to create multiple lines of text in the spectrogram.
.TP
.BI \-r " sample_rate \fR[8000]\fP"
This specifies the sampling rate of the output file. 
.TP
.BI \-a " amplitude \fR[500]\fP"
This is the zero-to-peak amplitude of each in each individual wavelet.
The worst case overall signal amplitude, assuming all vertical pixels
in a font matrix are on and all components in phase, is therefore
(\fIheight\fP * \fIamplitude\fP), where \fIheight\fP is the nominal
character height specified in the font file.  This value is written
as the \fImax_value\fP generic in the output header.  
.TP
.BI \-d " duration \fR[.02]\fP"
The nominal duration of the wavelets (seconds).
.TP
.BI \-s " step \fR[.01]\fP"
The time step between wavelets (dots in the matrix) (seconds).
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If \fIdebug_level\fP is positive, \fIebanner\fP prints debugging
messages and other information on the standard error output.  The
messages proliferate as \fIdebug_level\fP increases.  If
\fIdebug_level\fP is 0 (the default), no messages are printed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following commands create and display a 8Khz sampled data
file whose spectrogram reads "Hello, world!":
.nf

	% echo " Hello, world!" > hw
	% ebanner hw hw.sd
	% sgram hw.sd hw.fspec
	% xwaves hw.sd hw.fspec

.fi
The following commands create and display a 16Khz sampled data file
whose spectrum has two lines of text ("ebanner:", and "Hello, world!"):
.nf

	% echo "   ebanner:   " > eb
	% echo " Hello, world!" > hw
	% ebanner -r 16000 -l .6 eb eb.sd
	% ebanner -r 16000 -l .1 -h .5 hw hw.sd
	% addsd hw.sd eb.sd ebhw.sd
	% sgram ebhw.sd ebhw.fspec
	% xwaves ebhw.sd ebhw.fspec
