.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Frame
takes a single channel ESPS FEA_SD (sampled data) file, which contains
one sample per record, and produces an ESPS FEA file
.I output
with each record containing one frame of 
.I frame_len
samples (see
.B \-l
option).
The initial point of the first frame is determined by 
the \fB\-p\fP option or by \fIstart\fP in the parameter file.  
Initial points of any subsequent frames follow at equal intervals
.I step
(see
.B \-S
option).
Thus the 3 cases
.IR step " < " frame_len,
.IR step " = " frame_len,
and
.IR step " > " frame_len,
correspond to overlapping frames, exactly abutted frames,
and frames separated by gaps.
.PP
The number of frames
is the minimum sufficient to cover a specified range of
.I nan
points (see
.B \-p
option), given \fIframe_len\fP and \fIstep\fP.  The last frame in each file
may overrun the range, in which case a warning is printed.  If a frame
overruns the end of a file, it is filled out with zeros.
.PP
The sampled data in each frame optionally may be windowed using a
window function specified by the \fB\-w\fP option or by \fIwindown_type\fP 
in the parameter file.  To defer window processing, 
use \fIwindow\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).  
.PP
The output file is not of any special feature-file subtype.
It is tagged FEA file containing a 
.I float
vector field of sampled data of length 
.I frame_len.
By default, the field name is "sd", but this can be 
changed with the \fB\-f\fP option.  The tags in each record give the
starting point of the frame in \fIinput\fP.  
.PP
If 
.I input
is "\-" then the input is read from the standard input and if
.I
output
is "\-" then the output is directed to the standard output.
.sp
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param"
uses the parameter file 
.I param
rather than the default, which is
.I params.
.TP
.BI \-f " sd_field_name\fR [sd]\fP" 
Specifies the name of the sampled 
data field in \fIoutput\fP.
.TP
.BI \-{pr} " first" : "last"
.TP
.BI \-{pr} " first\-last"
.TP
.BI \-{pr} " first" :+ "incr"
In the first two forms, a pair of unsigned integers specifies the range of
sampled data to analyze.  If 
.IR last " = " first " + " incr,
the third form (with the plus sign) specifies the same range as the
first two forms.  If 
.I first
is omitted, the default value of 1 is used.  If 
.I last
is omitted, then the entire file is processed.
If the specified range contains points not in the file, zeros
are appended. Both forms of the option override the values of 
.I start
and
.I nan
in the parameter file or ESPS Common file.  If the \fB\-p\fP option or
\fB-r\fP options are not used, the range is determined from the ESPS
Parameter or Common file if the appropriate parameters are present.
Note that \fB-r\fP is a synonym for \fB-p\fP.  
.TP
.BI \-l " frame_len" "\fR [0]"
Specifies the length of each frame.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted.
A value of 0 (from either the option or the parameter file)
indicates that a single frame of length
.I nan
(see
.BR \-p )
is processed;
this is also the default value in case
.I frame_len
is not specified either with the
.B \-l
option or in the parameter file.
.TP
.BI \-S " step" "\fR [" frame_len "\fR]"
Initial points of consecutive frames differ by this number of samples.
If the option is omitted, the parameter file is consulted,
and if no value is found there, a default equal to
.I frame_len
is used (resulting in exactly abutted frames).  (The same default
applies if \fIstep\fP is given a value of 0).  
.TP
.BI \-w " window_type" "\fR[RECT]"
The name of the data window to apply to the data in each frame before
computing reflection coefficients.  If the option is omitted, the
parameter file is consulted, and if no value is found there, the
default used is a rectangular window with amplitude one.  Possible
window types include rectangular ("RECT"), Hamming ("HAMMING"),
Hanning ("HANNING"), cosine ("COS4"), and triangular ("TRIANG"); see
the window(3-ESPSsp) manual page for the complete list.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level" "\fR [0]"
A positive value specifies that debugging output be printed on the
standard error output.  Larger values result in more output.  The
default is 0, for no output.
.br
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
The parameter file is not required to be present, as there are 
default parameter values that apply.  If the parameter file 
does exist, the following parameters are read:
.TP
.I "sd_field_name \- string"
.IP
This is the name of the sampled data field created in \fIoutput\fP.
The default is "sd".  A parameter file value (if present) is overidden
by the \fB\-f\fP option.  
.TP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The first point in the input sampled data file that is processed.  A
value of 1 denotes the first sample in the file.  This is only read
if the \fB\-p\fP option is not used.  If it is not in the parameter
(or Common) file, the default value of 1 is used.  
.TP
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The total number of data points to process.  If 
.I nan
is 0, the whole file is processed.  
.I Nan
is read only if the \fB\-p\fP option is not used.  (See the 
discussion under \fB\-l\fP).
.TP
.I "frame_len - integer"
.IP
The number of points in each frame.  This parameter is not read if the
.B \-l
option is specified.  A value of 0 indicates that a single frame of length
.I nan
is processed; this is also the default value in case
.I frame_len
is specified neither with the
.B \-l
option nor in the parameter file.
.TP
.I "step \- integer"
Initial points of consecutive frames differ by this number of samples.
This parameter is not read if the
.B \-S
option is specified.
If the option is omitted and no value is found in the parameter file,
a default equal to
.I frame_len
is used (resulting in exactly abutted frames).
.TP
.I "window_type \- string"
The data window to apply to the data.
This parameter is not read if the command-line option
.B \-w
is specified.
If the option is omitted and if no value is found in the parameter file,
the default used is "RECT", for a rectangular window with amplitude one.
Other acceptable values include
"HAMMING", for Hamming, and "TRIANG", for triangular;
see the window(3-ESPSsp) manual page for the complete list.
.PP
The values of parameters obtained from the parameter file are printed
if the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE is 3 or greater.  The default
value is 3.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is read provided that Common processing is enabled and 
that the 
.I filename
entry in Common matches 
.I input,
in which case parameters present in Common override values from
the parameter file, which in turn may be overriden by command
line options (see the discussion in ESPS PARAMETERS and under
each option).   
Common is not read if 
.I input
is standard input.  
If 
.I output
is not standard output and 
.I input
is not standard input, the Common parameters 
\fIfilename\fP (= input), \fIprog\fP (= frame), 
.I start,
and
.I nan
are written to ESPS Common.
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback
of Common processing is determined by the environment variable
ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing
increasingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a
default value of 3 is assumed.
.SH ESPS HEADER
A new file header is created for the FEA_ANA file.  The sampled data header
from the input header is added as a source in the output file header, and
the command line is added as a comment.  Another comment gives the 
name of the field created by \fIframe\fP.  The input file \fIinput\fP is
set as the reference header for tags.
.PP
The program writes the usual values into the common part of the
output header.  
.I Frame
creates and writes the following generic header items
in the output file:
.nf
.sp
start = \fIstart\fP (LONG)
nan = \fInan\fP (LONG)
frmlen = \fIframe_len\fP (LONG)
src_sf = sample frequency of \fIinput\fP (FLOAT)
step = \fIstep\fP (LONG)
window_type = \fIwindow_type\fP (CODED) (not written for RECT window)
start_time
record_freq
.fi
.PP
The value written for \fIstart_time\fP is computed by taking the
\fIstart_time\fP value from the header of the input file (or zero, if
such a header item doesn't exist) and adding to it the relative time
from the first record in the file to the first record processed.  The
generic header item \fIrecord_freq\fP is the number of output records
per second of input
