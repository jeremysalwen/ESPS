.SH NAME

e2sphere \- convert ESPS FEA_SD sampled data files to Sphere (NIST) format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B e2sphere

.BI \-x " debug_level"

.I in.sd out.sphere
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIe2sphere\fP converts a single-channel, non-complex FT_SD or FEA_SD
file \fIin.sd\fP to Sphere format and writes the result to
\fIout.sphere\fP.  The input data can be any type, but are converted to
SHORT before output to \fIout.sphere\fP.
.PP
All scalar generic header items from \fIin.sd\fP are reproduced as
sphere header items in the header of \fIout.sphere\fP.  Note that
CODED generics from \fIin.sd\fP are converted as integers.  In
addition, the Sphere header items \fIchannel_count, sample_count,
sample_rate, sample_min, sample_max, sample_n_bytes,
sample_byte_format,\fP and \fIsample_sig_bits\fP are included in the
output header.
.PP
If \fIin.sd\fP "\-" then the input is read from the standard
input.  If \fIout.sphere\fP is "\-" then the output is directed to the
standard output.
.PP
\fIe2sphere\fP makes two passes over the data, once to find values for
\fIsample_min\fP and \fIsample_max\fP, and once to copy the data (with
appropriate conversions) from \fIin.sd\fP to \fIout.sphere\fP.  If
the input is stdin, a temporary file is created to permit the second
pass.
.sp
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-b " sample_byte_format" "\fR [10]"
Specifies the desired byte order in \fIout.sphere\fP.  Only "10" or
"01" are permitted.  If the value is "01", the data are byte-reversed
before output.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level" "\fR [0]"
A positive value specifies that debugging output be printed on the
standard error output.  Larger values result in more output.  The
default is 0, for no output.
.br
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
A parameter file is not read by \fIe2sphere\fP.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is not read by \fIe2sphere\fP.
.SH ESPS HEADER
All scalar generic header items from \fIin.sd\fP are reproduced as
sphere header items in the header of \fIout.sphere\fP.
