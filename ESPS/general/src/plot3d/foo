<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>plot3d</EM> reads data from a specified field of an ESPS FEA file
     and  constructs  a three-dimensional plot of the data versus
     two  independent  variables.   A  plot  of  data  from   the
     <EM>re</EM>_<EM>spec</EM>_<EM>val</EM>  field  of  a  FEA_SPEC file, for example, could
     show time along one axis, frequency along another axis,  and
     spectral  power  density  (or its log) along the third axis.
     In general, the <EM>x</EM>-axis corresponds to the order  of  records
     in the file, the <EM>y</EM>-axis corresponds to the order of elements
     in the field, and the <EM>z</EM>-axis  represents  the  data  values.
     The  three-dimensional  plot  is rendered in a window on the
     screen as a perspective drawing.

     The user has complete control over the scaling, orientation,
     depth  of perspective, and angle of view of the plot.  These
     plotting  parameters  are  set  initially  by   command-line
     options or values in an ESPS parameter file, but they can be
     adjusted interactively with mouse-operated sliders and other
     controls  in a control-panel window, or with mouse movements
     in the plot window.  Operating the controls causes  a  wire-
     frame  drawing  of  the bounding box of the plot to move and
     change size accordingly, and clicking on  a  button  in  the
     control-panel  window causes the plot to be redrawn with the
     new parameters.  The current set of parameters can be  saved
     to  a  file  so that other plots may later be drawn with the
     same viewpoint.  Saved parameter sets may be loaded  from  a
     file at any time.

     Data may be loaded from a file interactively; the file name,
     range  of records to be read, field name, and range of items
     in the field may all be respecified.

     A moving cursor, controlled by the mouse, allows the coordi-
     nates of points of the graph to be read off numerically.

     In addition to the display on the user's  screen;  the  plot
     image  may  be saved in a file, so that it can be printed or
     imported into a word processing system.  The plot image  can
     be  saved  as either PostScript or PCL.   It can be directly
     sent to a printer, if there is no need  to  save  the  image
     file.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options are supported.  Values in brackets are
     defaults.

     <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>depth</EM> [50]
          Depth of perspective.  A value of 0 corresponds to pro-
          jection   of   the   3-dimensional  plot  onto  the  2-
          dimensional   plotting   surface   from   an   infinite
          distancei.e.   parallel projection.  Positive values of
          <EM>depth</EM> correspond to projection from  inversely  propor-
          tional finite distances with the result that foreground
          features are shown at  a  somewhat  larger  scale  than
          features farther from the viewer.  The default value of
          50 is reasonable for normal viewing  distances.   Large
          values produce highly exaggerated perspective effects.

     <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <STRONG>"</STRONG><EM>field</EM><STRONG>[</STRONG><EM>range</EM><STRONG>]"</STRONG> ["re_spec_val[0:&lt;<EM>last</EM>&gt;]"]

     <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <EM>field</EM>
          Name of a field in an ESPS FEA file and range  of  ele-
          ments in field to be plotted.  (Numbering of field ele-
          ments starts with 0.)  The quotes are  needed  only  to
          suppress  the  shell's  usual special interpretation of
          brackets.  The bracketed <EM>range</EM>, if  present,  may  have
          any of the forms acceptable to <STRONG><A HREF="../man3.html/range_switch.3.html">range_switch(3-ESPSu)</A></STRONG>.

          <EM>element</EM>
               A single integer specifies a single field  element
               (not at present useful with <EM>plot3d</EM>).

          <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>last</EM>
               A pair of integers specifies an inclusive range of
               elements.

          <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:+</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>
               The form with  the  plus  sign  is  equivalent  to
               <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>last</EM> with <EM>last</EM> = <EM>first</EM> + <EM>incr</EM>.

          If the specified range contains elements not present in
          the field, the range is reduced as necessary.

     <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <EM>orientation</EM> [L]
          Left-handed coordinate  system  ("L")  or  right-handed
          ("R")?   When  the  axes  are  in their default initial
          position, record number increases  with  distance  from
          the  viewer,  element  number  increases  from  left to
          right, and data values increase in  the  upward  direc-
          tion.   For some possible positions, a mirror-reflected
          orientation  may  seem  more  natural.   Specifying   <EM>R</EM>
          instead  of <EM>L</EM> effectively reverses the direction of the
          <EM>y</EM> (element number) axis.

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <EM>range</EM> [1:&lt;<EM>end</EM> <EM>of</EM> <EM>file</EM>&gt;]
          Range of records in the file to  be  read  and  plotted
          (counting  the first as number 1.)  The allowable forms
          for <EM>range</EM> are those for <STRONG><A HREF="../man3.html/range_switch.3.html">range_switch(3-ESPSu)</A></STRONG>; see  the
          discussion  of   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>f</STRONG>  above  or the <EM>range</EM>_<EM>switch</EM> manual
          entry.

     <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>debug</EM>_<EM>level</EM> [0]
          Values greater than 0 cause various debugging  messages
          to  be printed as the program runs.  Larger values call
          out more messages.  The default level of  0  suppresses
          all debugging messages.

     <STRONG>-B</STRONG> <EM>length</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG><EM>width</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG><EM>height</EM> [400,250,150]
          Dimensions, in pixels, of a rectangular box that bounds
          the 3-d plot (except for axis labels and the like).

     <STRONG>-I</STRONG> {<STRONG>aAbBcCpP</STRONG>} . . . [abcp]
          Initial actions, taken when the plot  window  is  first
          brought  up.   Draw  axes (a, A), draw bounding box (b,
          B), bring up control panel (c, C), or plot data (p, P).
          A  lower-case  letters (a, b, c, p) invokes the action,
          and upper-case (A, B, C, P) suppresses it.

     <STRONG>-P</STRONG> <EM>param</EM>_<EM>file</EM> [params]
          Name of parameter file to be read initially.

     <STRONG>-R</STRONG> <EM>bearing</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG><EM>elevation</EM><STRONG>,</STRONG><EM>rotation</EM> [45.00,35.26,0.00]
          Three angles of rotation  (measured  in  degrees)  that
          describe  the  relative  positions of the 3-dimensional
          plot and the 2-dimensional plotting window.  The  <EM>bear-</EM>
          <EM>ing</EM>  and <EM>elevation</EM> determine the direction, relative to
          the 3-d coordinate system, of the line  normal  to  the
          window  at  its  center.  Changing the bearing lets you
          look at the plot from various sides, and increasing the
          elevation  lets you look at it from the top.  The third
          degree of freedom, ``<EM>rotation</EM>,'' corresponds to a rota-
          tion  about the line normal to the window at its center
          and for most purposes is probably best set equal to 0.

     <STRONG>-S</STRONG> <EM>h</EM>_<EM>skew</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>v</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> [0,0]
          Changing <EM>h</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> moves the front parts of the  plot  one
          way  horizontally  and  the  back parts of the plot the
          opposite way, in proportion to the distance forward  or
          back with respect to the plane of the plot window.  The
          effect is somewhat similar to adjusting  <EM>bearing</EM>  ( <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>R</STRONG>
          above)  in  that  both  adjustments let you see more or
          less of the left or right side of the  plot.   However,
          adjusting  <EM>h</EM>_<EM>skew</EM>  does not produce a rotation:  planes
          parallel to the plane of the  plot  window  remain  so.
          Similarly, changing <EM>v</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> moves the front parts of the
          plot one way vertically and the back part of  the  plot
          the  opposite  way.   The effect is somewhat similar to
          adjusting <EM>elevation</EM> in that both  adjustments  let  you
          see  more  or  less  of  the top of the plot.  However,
          adjusting <EM>v</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> does not produce a rotation of  planes
          parallel to the plot window.

     <STRONG>-w</STRONG>    This option causes <EM>plot3d</EM> to attempt to connect to  an
          <STRONG><A HREF="../man1.html/xwaves%2B.1.html">xwaves+(1 - ESPS)</A></STRONG> running with its server mode enabled.
          If this connection is made, then <EM>plot3d</EM> will send  cur-
          sor  movement  commands  to  <EM>xwaves</EM>+ to maintain cursor
          time alignment between the view in <EM>plot3d</EM> and the  view
          in <EM>xwaves</EM>+.   Note that <EM>plot3d</EM> has no way of knowing if
          the files  being  viewed  in  <EM>plot3d</EM>  and  <EM>xwaves</EM>+  are
          related  and if the time alignment makes sense.  A side
          effect of invoking this mode is to put  the  axis  into
          time  and  frequency display mode.   If the information
          in the displayed file cannot support this mode then the
          <STRONG>-w</STRONG>  option  is ignored.   For example, if the displayed
          file has no <EM>record</EM>_<EM>freq</EM> generic  then  then  it  cannot
          send time cursor movements to <EM>xwaves</EM>+. If the displayed
          file, is not a FEA_SPEC file, then it cannot send  fre-
          quency cursor movements to <EM>xwaves</EM>+.

          When this option  is  used,  the  environment  variable
          <STRONG>WAVES_HOST</STRONG>  is  read  to determine the name of the host
          that is running the <EM>xwaves</EM> server.   If  <STRONG>WAVES_HOST</STRONG>  is
          undefined,  then  the  connection  is  attempted  to an
          <EM>xwaves</EM>+ on the same host as <EM>plot3d</EM> is running on.   The
          default socket port number of the attempt is determined
          by a ESPS wide default which is compiled in.    If  the
          environment  variable  <STRONG>WAVES_PORT</STRONG>  is defined, then its
          value is used instead as the socket port. This  program
          uses  the  facility  of  <STRONG><A HREF="../man3.html/send_xwaves.3.html">send_xwaves(3 -ESPS)</A></STRONG>.  See its
          manual page for details.

     <STRONG>-M</STRONG>    This option forces <EM>plot3d</EM> to paint everything in black
          and  white (monochrome), useful if you're doing screen-
          dumps.




</PRE>
<H2>ESPS PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The parameter file is not required to be present,  as  there
     are  default values for all parameters.  If the file exists,
     the parameters below may be read.  These provide an alterna-
     tive  way  of  specifying quantities that can also be deter-
     mined by command-line options.  The general rule is that  if
     a  command-line option is specified, it takes precedence; if
     the command-line option is not specified, then the parameter
     file  is consulted; and if a quantity is not given either on
     the command line or in the parameter file, then a default is
     used.   Eventually  this program will support parameter-file
     entries corresponding to all command-line options except <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>x</STRONG>
     and <STRONG>-P</STRONG>.  These parameters may also be adjusted interactively
     from the control panel.  Current values may be  saved  to  a
     file,  and new values may be read from a file interactively.
     (See the discussion of the <EM>load</EM> <EM>params</EM> and <EM>save</EM> <EM>params</EM> items
     on  the  <EM>files</EM>  button  menu under "Control Panel and Menus"
     below.

     <EM>box</EM>_<EM>length</EM> - <EM>integer</EM>

     <EM>box</EM>_<EM>width</EM> - <EM>integer</EM>

     <EM>box</EM>_<EM>height</EM> - <EM>integer</EM>
          These correspond to the arguments  <EM>length</EM>,  <EM>width</EM>,  and
          <EM>height</EM> of the <STRONG>-B</STRONG> option.

     <EM>depth</EM> - <EM>float</EM>
          This corresponds to the argument of the <STRONG>-d</STRONG> option.

     <EM>horizontal</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> - <EM>float</EM>

     <EM>vertical</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> - <EM>float</EM>
          These correspond to the arguments <EM>h</EM>_<EM>skew</EM> and <EM>v</EM>_<EM>skew</EM>  of
          the <STRONG>-S</STRONG> option.

     <EM>orientation</EM> - <EM>string</EM>
          This corresponds to the argument of the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> option.

     <EM>bearing</EM> - <EM>float</EM>

     <EM>elevation</EM> - <EM>float</EM>

     <EM>rotation</EM> - <EM>float</EM>
          These correspond to the arguments of <STRONG>-R</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>CONTROL PANEL AND MENUS</H2><PRE>
     The <EM>length</EM>, <EM>width</EM>, and <EM>height</EM> sliders in  the  first  column
     adjust  the dimensions of the bounding box of the plot.  The
     <EM>scale</EM> slider allows all three dimensions to be increased  or
     decreased  by  the  same  factor  simultaneously.  The <EM>depth</EM>
     slider in the second column adjusts the  same  parameter  as
     the  parameter-file  entry  <EM>depth</EM>  or  the   <STRONG>-d</STRONG> command-line
     option.  Likewise the <EM>H</EM>. <EM>skew</EM> and <EM>V</EM>.  <EM>skew</EM>  sliders  in  the
     second column, the <EM>orientation</EM> selector in the third column,
     and the <EM>rotation</EM>, <EM>bearing</EM>, and <EM>skew</EM>  sliders  in  the  third
     column  adjust  the  same  parameters as the similarly named
     parameter-file  entries  or  command-line   arguments.    To
     operate  a  slider, move the cursor to the slider bar, press
     the left mouse button, and, while holding the  button  down,
     move the cursor left or right.


     There are buttons in the bottom row and the center top posi-
     tion  that  perform various functions.  To invoke one of the
     functions, move the cursor to the panel button and click the
     left  mouse button.  In addition, the three buttons (<EM>files</EM> ,
     <EM>axes</EM> and <EM>plot</EM>) marked with small triangles  have  associated
     menus.  To bring up one of the menus, move the cursor to the
     panel button and press the right mouse button.

     The <EM>plot</EM> button redraws the plot.  The associated  menu  has
     two items related to printing the graphic image of the plot.
     The <EM>print</EM> <EM>setup</EM> item invokes a setup panel that  allows  the
     user  to  configure  the  graphic  print  feature.    Select
     PostScript or PCL, Portrait or Landscape, resolution of out-
     put device, scaling factor, and output to a file or printer.
     In most cases a scale factor of about 4 is correct to fill a
     page  with  the  plot.    The  <EM>print</EM> <EM>graphic</EM> item causes the
     image on the screen to be  rerendered  with  the  parameters
     selected from the <EM>printer</EM> <EM>setup</EM> panel.

     The <EM>axes</EM> button draws or removes graduated <EM>x</EM>-,  <EM>y</EM>-,  and  <EM>z</EM>-
     axes  labeled  with the values at the two ends.  The associ-
     ated menu has an <EM>on</EM>/<EM>off</EM> item that performs the same function
     and two other items that control the scaling and labeling of
     two of the axes.

     Selecting the <EM>record</EM> <EM>labeling</EM> item brings up a submenu  with
     various options for the <EM>x</EM>-axis.  The default is to scale the
     axis in terms of record number  (counting  from  1  for  the
     first  record  in the file).  The item <EM>time</EM> (<EM>from</EM> <EM>rec</EM> #) can
     be selected when the header item "record_freq" is defined in
     the  input  file  header.   It relabels the axis in units of
     time, where the time associated with a record is  <EM>start</EM>_<EM>time</EM>
     +   (<EM>record</EM>_<EM>number</EM> - 1)/<EM>record</EM>_<EM>freq</EM>.   If  the  header  item
     "start_time" is not present, 0 is used for  <EM>start</EM>_<EM>time</EM>.  The
     item  <EM>tag</EM> can be selected when the input file is tagged.  It
     relabels the axis in terms of tags (<EM>i</EM>.<EM>e</EM>.  record  or  sample
     numbers  in  the ``refer'' file of the input filesee <EM>ESPS</EM>(5-
     ESPS) or <STRONG><A HREF="../man5.html/FEA.5.html">FEA(5-ESPS)</A></STRONG>).  The item  <EM>time</EM>  (<EM>from</EM>  <EM>tag</EM>)  can  be
     selected  when  the input file is tagged and the header item
     "src_sf" is defined in its  header.   (In  a  FEA_SPEC  file
     without  "src_sf",  the  header item "sf" is accepted in its
     place.)  This item relabels the axis in units of time, where
     the time associated with a record is (<EM>tag</EM>-1)/<EM>src</EM>_<EM>sf</EM>.

     Selecting the <EM>item</EM> <EM>labeling</EM> item of  the  <EM>axes</EM>  button  menu
     brings  up  a  submenu  with  options  for  the <EM>y</EM>-axis.  The
     default is to scale the axis  in  terms  of  element  number
     (counting  from  0  for  the first element of a field).  The
     item <EM>frequency</EM> can be selected when  the  input  file  is  a
     FEA_SPEC  file whose "freq_format" (see <STRONG><A HREF="../man5.html/FEA_SPEC.5.html">FEA_SPEC(5-ESPS)</A></STRONG>) is
     not SPFMT_ARB_VAR.  It relabels the axis in  units  of  fre-
     quency,  where  the  frequency  of  each  field  element  is
     determined by values in the  file  header  (see  <EM>FEA</EM>_<EM>SPEC</EM>(5-
     ESPS)).

     If a file has nonuniformly spaced tags, switching the <EM>x</EM>-axis
     labeling between <EM>record</EM> or <EM>time</EM> (<EM>from</EM> <EM>rec</EM> #) and <EM>tag</EM> or <EM>time</EM>
     (<EM>from</EM> <EM>tag</EM>) renders the plot incorrect.  It  is  not  redrawn
     automatically,  so  you  should do it manually with the <EM>plot</EM>
     button.  Similarly, if the input file  is  a  FEA_SPEC  file
     whose  "freq_format" is SPFMT_ARB_FIXED, and the frequencies
     defined in the header are nonuniformly  spaced,  you  should
     redraw  the plot after switching the <EM>y</EM>-axis labeling between
     <EM>item</EM> <EM>number</EM> and <EM>frequency</EM>.

     Selecting the item <EM>enable</EM> <EM>waves</EM> <EM>cursors</EM> causes  the  program
     to  attempt  to  connect to an <EM>xwaves</EM>+ in server mode.   See
     the section about the <STRONG>-w</STRONG> option.

     The item <EM>disable</EM> <EM>waves</EM> <EM>cursor</EM> turns off this mode.

     The <EM>box</EM> button draws or removes  the  bounding  box  of  the
     plot.

     The <EM>clear</EM> button clears the plot window.

     The <EM>points</EM> button plots individual data points without  con-
     necting lines or hidden-line removal.

     The <EM>help</EM> button brings up a  window  containing  the  <EM>plot3d</EM>
     manual entry.

     The <EM>quit</EM> button terminates the program.

     The <EM>file</EM> button  has  an  associated  menu  with  items  for
     interactively  reading  new data, reading new parameters, or
     writing out the current parameters.  Clicking on this  panel
     button  with  the left mouse button activates the first menu
     item, <EM>load</EM> <EM>data</EM>. Clicking with the right mouse button brings
     up the menu and lets any item be selected.

     The <EM>load</EM> <EM>data</EM> menu item brings up a panel for  reading  data
     from  a  new file or reading a different part of the data in
     the same file.  The panel has various text fields  that  you
     can  type  into and a <EM>load</EM> button for reading the data after
     the text fields are filled in  to  your  satisfaction.   The
     <EM>directory</EM>  field may be left blank.  If it contains a direc-
     tory, the program supplies a terminating  "/"  and  prefixes
     the result to the <EM>file</EM> field to get the pathname of the file
     to be read.  The text field labeled <EM>field</EM> should  contain  a
     FEA  file field name defined in the header of the file to be
     read.  The pair of fields after -<EM>r</EM> determine  the  range  of
     records  to  be  read.   Either  of the forms <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>last</EM> and
     <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:+</STRONG><EM>incr</EM> allowed with the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> command-line option  may  be
     used.  Leaving the fields blank gets the defaults.  The same
     holds for the pair of  fields  between  brackets  after  the
     field  name,  which determine the range of field elements to
     be read.

     The <EM>load</EM> <EM>params</EM> menu item brings up a panel  for  redefining
     parameter  values by reading a file.  To use it, fill in the
     text fields to specify a file that has the format of an ESPS
     parameter  file  (see  <EM>read</EM>_<EM>params</EM> (<EM>3</EM>-<EM>ESPSu</EM>)); then click on
     the <EM>load</EM> button.

     The <EM>save</EM> <EM>params</EM> menu item brings up a panel for  saving  the
     current  parameter  values  to  a  specified  file  in  ESPS
     parameter-file  format.   If  the  specified  file   already
     exists, it is overwritten.

     Moving the mouse cursor into the base rectangle of the  plot
     box in the plot window brings up a set of cursors with which
     you can use the mouse to select values  of  the  independent
     variables  (<EM>e</EM>.<EM>g</EM>.   time  and frequency) and see these values
     together  with  the  corresponding  data  value  in  digital
     readouts  at  the  top of the plot window.  Moving the mouse
     anywhere in the plot window with a  mouse  button  depressed
     gives  you alternative ways of doing things you could accom-
     plish with the controls in the control panel.  With the left
     button down, horizontal and vertical mouse movements control
     the horizontal skew  parameters.   With  the  middle  button
     down,  horizontal and vertical mouse movements control bear-
     ing and elevation.  Pressing the right mouse  button  brings
     up a menu with items that duplicate some of the panel-button
     functions:  <EM>plot</EM>, <EM>axes</EM>, <EM>box</EM>, <EM>print</EM> <EM>setup</EM>, <EM>print</EM> and <EM>clear</EM>.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     There are positions for the plot for  which  transformations
     used  in the hidden-line-elimination algorithm become singu-
     lar, with disastrous results for the appearance of the plot.
     This  can  occur,  for example, if you are viewing planes of
     the plot directly edge-on.  Usually, slightly perturbing the
     position  of  the  box  or moving the <EM>depth</EM> control a little
     away from 0 will clear up the problem.  If you view the plot
     from  a  position such that some planes of the plot are seen
     from the front and some from the  back,  you  may  notice  a
     break  in  the  edge between the two parts of the plot.  The
     axes and the box can  interfere:   a  line  segment  of  one
     superposed  on  a segment of the other yields a segment of a
     third color that may be invisible, or nearly so, against the
     background.   The  cursors  in the base plane may get out of
     coordination with the actual mouse position.   Toggling  the
     axes on and off will get them back in step.

<H2>FUTURE CHANGES</H2><PRE>
     Fix the bugs noted above.  Allow adding straight lines  con-
     necting  the edges of the plot to the edges of the base rec-
     tangle.  Show underside of the plot.  Allow plotting "longi-
     tudinal" traces (connecting points in different records, but
     with the same element number) instead of, or in addition  to
     the  present "lateral" traces (connecting points in the same
     record, but with different element numbers).  Allow  select-
     ing slices with the mouse for plotting in a separate window.
     Parameters and command-line options for controlling the axis
     limits  (now  determined automatically from the data).  Con-
     trol over box dimensions by mouse movements in the plot win-
     dow.   Better  rendering  of  axes.  "Footprint" (color base
     rectangle differently from background).  Decent-looking axis
     titles.   Other  choices  for  axis labeling (e.g. specified
     header item or scalar field).  Allow specifying input record
     and element ranges in "engineering units."  Intuitive inter-
     face for controlling all three rotational degrees of freedom
     with  mouse  movements in the plane.  Control over the color
     scheme.
