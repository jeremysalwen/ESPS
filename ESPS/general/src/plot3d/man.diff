.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I plot3d
reads data from a specified field of an ESPS FEA file
and constructs a three-dimensional plot
of the data versus two independent variables.
A plot of data from the
.I re_spec_val
field of a FEA_SPEC file, for example,
could show time along one axis, frequency along another axis,
and spectral power density (or its log) along the third axis.
In general, the
.IR x -axis
corresponds to the order of records in the file,
the
.IR y -axis
corresponds to the order of elements in the field,
and the
.IR z -axis
represents the data values.
The three-dimensional plot is rendered in a window on the screen
as a perspective drawing.
.PP
The user has complete control
over the scaling, orientation, depth of perspective, and angle of view
of the plot.
These plotting parameters are set initially
by command-line options or values in an ESPS parameter file,
but they can be adjusted interactively
with mouse-operated sliders and other controls in a control-panel window,
or with mouse movements in the plot window.
Operating the controls
causes a wire-frame drawing of the bounding box of the plot
to move and change size accordingly,
and clicking on a button in the control-panel window
causes the plot to be redrawn with the new parameters.
The current set of parameters can be saved to a file so that other plots
may later be drawn with the same viewpoint.
Saved parameter sets may be loaded from a file at any time.
.PP
Data may be loaded from a file interactively;
the file name, range of records to be read, field name,
and range of items in the field may all be respecified.
.PP
A moving cursor, controlled by the mouse,
allows the coordinates of points of the graph to be read off numerically.
.PP
In addition to the display on the user's screen; the plot image may be
saved in a file, so that it can be printed or imported into a word processing
system.  The plot image can be saved as either PostScript or PCL.   It can
be directly sent to a printer, if there is no need to save the image file.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported.  Values in brackets are defaults. 
.TP
.BI "\-d " depth " \fR[50]"
Depth of perspective.
A value of 0 corresponds to projection of the 3-dimensional plot
onto the 2-dimensional plotting surface from an infinite distance\c
.RI \*- i.e.
parallel projection.
Positive values of
.I depth
correspond to projection from inversely proportional finite distances
with the result that foreground features
are shown at a somewhat larger scale than features farther from the viewer.
The default value of 50 is reasonable for normal viewing distances.
Large values produce highly exaggerated perspective effects.
.TP
\fB\-f "\fIfield\fB\^[\^\fIrange\fB\^]\^"\fR ["re_spec_val[0:<\fIlast\fR>]"]
.TP
.BI "\-f " field
Name of a field in an ESPS FEA file
and range of elements in field to be plotted.
(Numbering of field elements starts with 0.)
The quotes are needed only
to suppress the shell's usual special interpretation of brackets.
The bracketed
.I range,
if present, may have any of the forms acceptable to
.IR range_switch (3-ESPSu).
.RS
.TP
.I element
A single integer specifies a single field element
(not at present useful with
.IR plot3d ).
.TP
.IB first : last
A pair of integers specifies an inclusive range of elements.
.TP
.IB first :+ incr
The form with the plus sign is equivalent to
.IB first : last
with
.IR last " = " first " + " incr.
.RE
.IP
If the specified range contains elements not present in the field,
the range is reduced as necessary.
.TP
.BI "\-o " orientation " \fR[L]"
Left-handed coordinate system ("L") or right-handed ("R")?
When the axes are in their default initial position,
record number increases with distance from the viewer,
element number increases from left to right,
and data values increase in the upward direction.
For some possible positions,
a mirror-reflected orientation may seem more natural.
Specifying
.I R
instead of
.I L
effectively reverses the direction of the
.I y
(element number) axis.
.TP
.BI "\-r " range " \fR[1:<\fIend of file\fR>]"
Range of records in the file to be read and plotted
(counting the first as number 1.)
The allowable forms for
.I range
are those for
.IR range_switch (3-ESPSu);
see the discussion of
.B \-f
above or the
.I range_switch
manual entry.
.TP
.BI "\-x " debug_level " \fR[0]"
Values greater than 0
cause various debugging messages to be printed as the program runs.
Larger values call out more messages.
The default level of 0 suppresses all debugging messages.
.TP
.BI "\-B " length , width , "height \fR[400,250,150]"
Dimensions, in pixels, of a rectangular box that bounds the 3-d plot
(except for axis labels and the like).
.TP
.BR "\-I " { aAbBcCpP "} . . ." " \fR[abcp]"
Initial actions, taken when the plot window is first brought up.
Draw axes (a, A), draw bounding box (b, B), bring up control panel (c, C),
or plot data (p, P).
A lower-case letters (a, b, c, p) invokes the action,
and upper-case (A, B, C, P) suppresses it.
.TP
.BI "\-P " param_file " \fR[params]"
Name of parameter file to be read initially.
.TP
.BI "\-R " bearing , elevation , "rotation \fR[45.00,35.26,0.00]"
Three angles of rotation (measured in degrees)
that describe the relative positions
of the 3-dimensional plot and the 2-dimensional plotting window.
The
.I bearing
and
.I elevation
determine the direction, relative to the 3-d
coordinate system, of the line normal to the window at its center.
Changing the bearing lets you look at the plot from various sides,
and increasing the elevation lets you look at it from the top.
The third degree of freedom,
.I ``rotation,''
corresponds to a rotation about the line normal to the window at its center
and for most purposes is probably best set equal to 0.
.TP
.BI "\-S " h_skew : v_skew " \fR[0,0]"
Changing
.I h_skew
moves the front parts of the plot one way horizontally
and the back parts of the plot the opposite way,
in proportion to the distance forward or back
with respect to the plane of the plot window.
The effect is somewhat similar to adjusting
.I bearing
.RB ( \-R
above) in that both adjustments
let you see more or less of the left or right side of the plot.
However, adjusting
.I h_skew
does not produce a rotation:
planes parallel to the plane of the plot window remain so.
Similarly, changing
.I v_skew
moves the front parts of the plot one way vertically
and the back part of the plot the opposite way.
The effect is somewhat similar to adjusting
.I elevation
in that both adjustments let you see more or less of the top of the plot.
However, adjusting
.I v_skew
does not produce a rotation of planes parallel to the plot window.
.TP
.B \-w
This option causes \fIplot3d\fR to attempt to connect to an
\fIxwaves\fR(1\-ESPS) running with its server mode enabled.   If
this connection is made, then \fIplot3d\fR will send cursor movement commands
to \fIxwaves+\fR to maintain cursor time alignment between the view in
\fIplot3d\fR and the view in \fIxwaves+\fR.   Note that \fIplot3d\fR has
no way of knowing if the files being viewed in \fIplot3d\fR and
\fIxwaves+\fR are related and if the time alignment makes sense.
A side effect of invoking this mode is to put the axis into time and
frequency display mode.   If the information in the displayed file
cannot support this mode then the \fB-w\fR option is ignored.   For
example, if the displayed file has no \fIrecord_freq\fR generic then then
it cannot send time cursor movements to \fIxwaves+\fR.   
If the displayed file, is not a
FEA_SPEC file, then it cannot send frequency cursor movements to
\fIxwaves+\fR.  
.sp
When this option is used, the environment variable \fBWAVES_HOST\fR is
read to determine the name of the host that is running the \fIxwaves\fR
server.   If \fBWAVES_HOST\fR is undefined, then the connection is
attempted to an \fIxwaves+\fR on the same host as \fIplot3d\fR is running
on.   The default socket port number of the attempt is determined by a
ESPS wide default which is compiled in.    If the environment variable
\fBWAVES_PORT\fR is defined, then its value is used instead as the
socket port. This program uses the facility of
\fIsend_xwaves\fR(3\-ESPS).  See its manual page for details.
.TP 
.B \-M
This option forces \fIplot3d\fP to paint everything in black and 
white (monochrome), useful if you're doing screendumps.

.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The parameter file is not required to be present,
as there are default values for all parameters.
If the file exists, the parameters below may be read.
These provide an alternative way of specifying quantities
that can also be determined by command-line options.
The general rule is that if a command-line option is specified,
it takes precedence;
if the command-line option is not specified,
then the parameter file is consulted;
and if a quantity
is not given either on the command line or in the parameter file,
then a default is used.
Eventually this program will support parameter-file entries corresponding
to all command-line options except
.B \-x
and
.BR \-P .
These parameters may also be adjusted interactively from the control panel.
Current values may be saved to a file,
and new values may be read from a file interactively.
(See the discussion of the
.I load params
and
.I save params
items on the
.I files
button menu under "Control Panel and Menus" below.
.TP
.I box_length \- integer

option.
.TP
.I depth \- float
This corresponds to the argument of the
.B \-d
option.
.TP

.SH "CONTROL PANEL AND MENUS"
.PP
The
.I length,
.I width,
and
.I height
sliders in the first column
adjust the dimensions of the bounding box of the plot.
The
.I scale
slider allows all three dimensions
to be increased or decreased by the same factor simultaneously.
The
.I depth
slider in the second column adjusts the same parameter as the
parameter-file entry
.I depth
or the
.B \-d
command-line option.
Likewise the
.I H. skew
and
.I V. skew
sliders in the second column, the
.I orientation
selector in the third column, and the
.I rotation,
.I bearing,
and
.I skew
sliders in the third column
adjust the same parameters as the similarly named parameter-file entries
or command-line arguments.
To operate a slider, move the cursor to the slider bar,
press the left mouse button, and, while holding the button down,
move the cursor left or right.
.PP
There are buttons in the bottom row and the center top position
that perform various functions.
To invoke one of the functions,
move the cursor to the panel button and click the left mouse button.
In addition, the three buttons
.RI ( files
,
.I axes 
and
.IR plot )
marked with small triangles have associated menus.
To bring up one of the menus,
move the cursor to the panel button and press the right mouse button.
.PP
The
.I plot
button redraws the plot.
The associated menu has two items related to printing the graphic image of the
plot.  The \fIprint setup\fR item invokes a setup panel that allows the user
to configure the graphic print feature.   Select PostScript or PCL, Portrait
or Landscape, resolution of output device, scaling factor, and output to 
a file or printer.   In most cases a scale factor of about 4 is correct to fill
a page with the plot.   The \fIprint graphic\fR item causes the image on the 
screen to be rerendered with the parameters selected from 
the \fIprinter setup\fR panel.   
.PP
The
.I axes
button draws or removes graduated
.I x-, y-,
and
.IR z- axes
labeled with the values at the two ends.
The associated menu has an
.I on/off
item that performs the same function
and two other items that control the scaling and labeling of two of the axes.
.PP
Selecting the
.I record labeling
item brings up a submenu with various options for the
.IR x- axis.
The default is to scale the axis in terms of record number
(counting from 1 for the first record in the file).
The item
.I time (from rec #)
can be selected
when the header item "record_freq" is defined in the input file header.
It relabels the axis in units of time,
where the time associated with a record is
.I start_time
+
.RI ( record_number "\^\-\^1)/" record_freq.
If the header item "start_time" is not present, 0 is used for
.I start_time.
The item
.I tag
can be selected when the input file is tagged.
It relabels the axis in terms of tags
.RI ( i.e.
record or sample numbers in the ``refer'' file of the input file\*-see
.IR ESPS (5-ESPS)
or
.IR FEA (5-ESPS)).
The item
.I time (from tag)
can be selected when the input file is tagged and the header item "src_sf"
is defined in its header.
(In a FEA_SPEC file without "src_sf",
the header item "sf" is accepted in its place.)
This item relabels the axis in units of time,
where the time associated with a record is
.RI ( tag "\^\-\^1)/" src_sf.
.PP
Selecting the
.I item labeling
item of the
.I axes
button menu
brings up a submenu with options for the
.IR y- axis.
The default is to scale the axis in terms of element number
(counting from 0 for the first element of a field).
The item
.I frequency
can be selected when the input file is a FEA_SPEC file
whose "freq_format" (see
.IR FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS))
is not SPFMT_ARB_VAR.
It relabels the axis in units of frequency,
where the frequency of each field element
is determined by values in the file header (see
.IR FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS)).
.PP
If a file has nonuniformly spaced tags, switching the
.IR x- axis
labeling between
.I record
or
.I time (from rec #)
and
.I tag
or
.I time (from tag)
renders the plot incorrect.
It is not redrawn automatically,
so you should do it manually with the
.I plot
button.
Similarly, if the input file is a FEA_SPEC file
whose "freq_format" is SPFMT_ARB_FIXED,
and the frequencies defined in the header are nonuniformly spaced,
you should redraw the plot after switching the
.IR y- axis
labeling between
.I item number
and
.I frequency.
.PP
Selecting the item \fIenable waves cursors\fR causes the program to
attempt to connect to an \fIxwaves+\fR in server mode.   See the section
about the \fB-w\fR option.
.PP
The item \fIdisable waves cursor\fR turns off this mode.
.PP
The
.I box
button draws or removes the bounding box of the plot.
.PP
The
.I clear
button clears the plot window.
.PP
The
.I points
button plots individual data points
without connecting lines or hidden-line removal.
.PP
The
.I help
button brings up a window containing the
.I plot3d
manual entry.
.PP
The
.I quit
button terminates the program.
.PP
The
.I file
button has an associated menu with items
for interactively reading new data, reading new parameters,
or writing out the current parameters.
Clicking on this panel button with the left mouse button activates the first
menu item,
.I load data.
Clicking with the right mouse button
brings up the menu and lets any item be selected.
.PP
The
.I load data
menu item brings up a panel for reading data from a new file or reading
a different part of the data in the same file.
The panel has various text fields that you can type into and a
.I load
button for reading the data
after the text fields are filled in to your satisfaction.
The
.I directory
field may be left blank.
If it contains a directory, the program supplies a terminating "/"
and prefixes the result to the
.I file
field to get the pathname of the file to be read.
The text field labeled
.I field
should contain a FEA file field name
defined in the header of the file to be read.
The pair of fields after
.I \-r
determine the range of records to be read.
Either of the forms
.IB first : last
and
.IB first :+ incr
allowed with the
.B \-r
command-line option may be used.
Leaving the fields blank gets the defaults.
The same holds for the pair of fields between brackets after the field name,
which determine the range of field elements to be read.
.PP
The
.I load params
menu item brings up a panel
for redefining parameter values by reading a file.
To use it, fill in the text fields to specify a file that has the format
of an ESPS parameter file (see
.I read_params (3-ESPSu));
then click on the
.I load
button.
.PP
The
.I save params
menu item brings up a panel for saving the current parameter values
to a specified file in ESPS parameter-file format.
If the specified file already exists, it is overwritten.
.PP
Moving the mouse cursor into the base rectangle of the plot box
in the plot window
brings up a set of cursors with which
you can use the mouse to select values of the independent variables
.RI ( e.g.
time and frequency)
and see these values together with the corresponding data value
in digital readouts at the top of the plot window.
Moving the mouse anywhere in the plot window with a mouse button depressed
gives you alternative ways of doing things you could accomplish with the
controls in the control panel.
With the left button down, horizontal and vertical mouse movements control
the horizontal skew parameters.
With the middle button down, horizontal and vertical mouse movements control
bearing and elevation.
Pressing the right mouse button brings up a menu with items that duplicate
some of the panel-button functions:
.I plot, axes, box, print setup, print graphic,
and
.I clear.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Many error conditions will print diagnostic messages to
.I stdout.
Some errors in the use of the
.I load data, load params,
and
.I save params
panels cause error messages in red to appear in the panels.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
There are positions for the plot
for which transformations used in the hidden-line-elimination algorithm
become singular, with disastrous results for the appearance of the plot.
This can occur, for example,
if you are viewing planes of the plot directly edge-on.
Usually, slightly perturbing the position of the box or moving the
.I depth
control a little away from 0 will clear up the problem.
If you view the plot from a position such that some planes of the plot are
seen from the front and some from the back, you may notice a break in the edge
between the two parts of the plot.
The axes and the box can interfere:
a line segment of one superposed on a segment of the other yields a segment
of a third color that may be invisible, or nearly so, against the background.
The cursors in the base plane may get out of coordination with the actual
mouse position.  Toggling the axes on and off will get them back in step.
.SH "FUTURE CHANGES"
.PP
Fix the bugs noted above.
Allow adding straight lines connecting the edges of the plot
to the edges of the base rectangle.
Show underside of the plot.
Allow plotting "longitudinal" traces
(connecting points in different records, but with the same element number)
instead of, or in addition to the present "lateral" traces
(connecting points in the same record, but with different element numbers).
Allow selecting slices with the mouse for plotting in a separate window.
Parameters and command-line options for controlling the axis limits
(now determined automatically from the data).
Control over box dimensions by mouse movements in the plot window.
Better rendering of axes.
"Footprint" (color base rectangle differently from background).
Decent-looking axis titles.
Other choices for axis labeling (e.g. specified header item or scalar field).
Allow specifying input record and element ranges in "engineering units."
Intuitive interface for controlling all three rotational degrees of freedom
with mouse movements in the plane.
Control over the color scheme.
