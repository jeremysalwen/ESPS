NAME
     send_xwaves - open a connection to  an  xwaves+  via  the  X
     server


SYNOPSIS
     send_xwaves [ -h display name ] [ -d reply delay  ]  [   - D
     startup  delay  ]  [  -n destination application name ] [ -x
     debug_level ] [ xwaves command ]


DESCRIPTION
     send_xwaves uses communications through the X server to com-
     municate  with xwaves(1-ESPS).  This program connects to the
     default X server (like any other X program) to  establish  a
     communications  link  with an xwaves running on that server.
     An alternate display server name can be specified  by  using
     the  -h option.  This is given in the usual X convention, of
     hostname:display:screen, and  is  most  often  simply  host-
     name:0.0.    The  host  running send_xwaves must have access
     permission to the X server that xwaves is displaying  on  in
     order for the communications link to be established.  If the
     -h option is not given, then the value  of  the  environment
     variable  DISPLAY is used, as is the case in all X programs.
     By default, send_xwaves will look for  an  application  that
     has registered by the name of xwaves with the X server.   To
     specify an alternate name, use the -n option.  The name that
     an  xwaves  registers  under  is  given on its control panel
     title bar.

     Send_xwaves will continue trying to establish connection for
     the  delay interval specified using the -D option [10 sec by
     default].

     A single xwaves command can be given on  the  command  line,
     following any option flags and arguments.  In this mode, the
     connection is opened, the command is sent, and  the  connec-
     tion  is closed.  When using this mode, you must be aware of
     how the shell you are using handles  special  characters  on
     the command line and how to escape them.  Unless blocking is
     disabled with the -B option,  send_xwaves  will  wait  until
     xwaves signals that the command has been processed for up to
     the number of seconds specified  by  the  - d  option  (2000
     seconds,  by  default).  In this mode, any value returned by
     the remote procedure call processed on the host  (e.g.  from
     xwaves "get" commands) will be sent to send_xwaves' standard
     output.

     If no command is given on  the  command  line,  send_xwaves,
     attempts  to  open a connection to an xwaves, waiting for up
     to startup delay seconds, and then reads an arbitrary number
     of  commands from standard input and sends them, waiting for

     a response from the server between each request, unless  the
     - B  flag is set.  When send_xwaves reads EOF, it closes the
     connection  and  exits  immediately.   This  way  of   using
     send_xwaves  is  convenient  if you wish to have a window in
     which you can just type xwaves commands, or when  a  routine
     set  of  commands  is  to  be  executed from a file or other
     source.

     If the -B flag is set, send_xwaves processes all commands in
     the  input stream with no interlock between requests.  Thus,
     when a batch of commands are sent with  - B  enabled,  these
     commands should not be interdependent (i.e. the success of a
     command in the batch should not depend upon  the  completion
     of a previous command).

     Given a file of xwaves commands, one could send them all  to
     xwaves  by  cat-ing  the file to the send_xwaves stdin.  One
     could also cause xwaves to invoke the command file  directly
     by  using send_xwaves to send an "@filename", where filename
     is the name of a file containing the  commands  to  be  exe-
     cuted.

     The options described below override both the  default,  and
     the environment variables.


OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -h display name
          The X server name that the target xwaves is  displaying
          on.  This  is  given in the usual X server name conven-
          tion; host:display.screen.  If the option is not given,
          then  the  value of the environment variable DISPLAY is
          used.

     -n destination application name
          The name of the xwaves application to connect to.   The
          default name is xwaves.  The name might be different if
          more than one xwaves is displaying on the  display,  or
          if  a  non-standard  name was specified upon startup of
          xwaves.

     -D startup delay [10 seconds]
          Send_xwaves will keep trying for up  to  startup  delay
          seconds  before  concluding  that  IxwavesR  can not be
          reached.  If the timeout period is reached  before  the
          connection  is  established,  send_xwaves exits with an
          error message and error status.

     -d reply delay [2000 seconds]
          When  operating  in  the  single   command-line   mode,

SEND_XWAVES(1-ESPS)Misc. Reference Manual PageSEND_XWAVES(1-ESPS)



          send_xwaves  will  wait  up  to reply delay seconds for
          xwaves to process the request and return a value.  If a
          response  is not received within this time, send_xwaves
          exits with an error message and error status.

     -B [blocking enabled]
          This option disables the  blocking  behavior  described
          above.   When -B is specified, send_xwaves observes the
          startup delay, but does not wait for  any  acknowledge-
          ment from xwaves after a command is sent.

     -x debug_level [0]
          A positive value specifies  that  debugging  output  be
          printed  on  the  standard error output.  Larger values
          result in more output.  The default is 0, for  no  out-
          put.

EXAMPLES
     Suppose you had xwaves displaying on host yorba.  You  could
     cause it to exit with:

          send_xwaves -h "yorba:0.0" quit

     If xwaves was displaying on the same X  server  as  was  the
     default for the process running the send_xwaves, then the -h
     option would not have been necessary.

     If xwaves was displaying file foo.sd in  ensemble  foo,  you
     could  cause the time interval from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds to be
     displayed with:

          send_xwaves foo bracket file foo.sd start 1.5 end 2.5

     The xwaves test script located in  $ESPS_BASE/bin/test_waves
     contains many examples of the use of send_xwaves.

ESPS PARAMETERS
     The ESPS parameter file has no effect on this program.

ESPS COMMON
     This program has no interaction with ESPS common.

ESPS HEADER
     This program does not directly handle ESPS files, so it  has
     no effect on ESPS file headers.
