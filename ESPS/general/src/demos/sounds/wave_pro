# This file specifies many of the parameters for the program waves.
# Specifications take the form

# One or several of these pairs may appear on each line.  Lines in this
# file which begin with # are ignored.  The comments and blank lines seen here
# are optional and may be deleted in personalized copies.  A full set of
# specifications is included here as documentation, but any subset
# is acceptable.  If specifications are to be deleted, remove both the
# keyword and the value.  This file is accessed by get_globals() in globals.c.

# minimum height in pixels of spectrogram windows 
# If min_spec_height is larger than the "natural" height of 
# spectrogram windows (which is somewhat more than the number of FFT 
# points), and if vertical rescaling is enabled (v_spect_rescale == 1), 
# then spectrogram windows will be rescaled vertically when painted.  
# Set this to 50 to avoid any rescaling on initial window display (i.e.,
# for fastest painting)
# Limits:	50 to 900  (pixels)
min_spec_height 275

# minimum width in pixels of spectrogram windows 
# Initial spectrogram painting puts up one pixel-column per record 
# (i.e., per FFT). The "natural" width is somewhat more than the 
# number of records (it this fits on the screen).  If min_spec_width
# is larger than the number of records, a larger window is created.  
# You might want larger windows to see more of the digital readouts.

# funcname	xspectrum

#Here are a few globals that allow control of the xlabel control window
#position, the xspectrum control window position, and the xspectrum
#plot (data) window position and size 

#These two set the X and Y positions of the xlabel control window:
xlabel_ctlwin_x 700
xlabel_ctlwin_y 0

#These two set the X and Y positions of the xspectrum control window:
xspectrum_ctlwin_x      0
xspectrum_ctlwin_y      0

#These two set the width and height of xspectrum data (plot) windows
#(there can be more than one plot window - one per object):
xspectrum_datwin_height 275
xspectrum_datwin_width  455

#xspectrum_datwin_x and xspectrum_datwin_y control the initial
#position of the xspectrum data (plot window) if there is only one
#display object.  Positive values for xspectrum_datwin_x or
#xspectrum_datwin_y specify respectively the X and Y position of the
#xspectrum plot window if there is only one display object at the time
#the plot window is displayed.  If there is more than one display
#object, the xspectrum plot window is aligned with the first display
#window of the corresponding xwaves+ display object, with the xspectrum
#display directly underneath the left side of the xwaves+ window.  If
#xspectrum_data_win_x is negative, the top of all xspectrum plot
#windows is positioned directly underneath the first xwaves+ display
#window of the corresponding object.  If xspectrum_data_win_y is
#negative, the left side of all xspectrum plot windows is lined up
#(vertically) with the left side of the first xwaves+ display window of
#the corresponding object.

# image_clip is used by the digital halftone algorithm; 
# (Spectrograms are displayed in digital halftone form on monochrome 
# monitors or when do_color is set to 0).  When

image_clip 7

# image_range is also used by the digital halftone algorithm; 
# Everything below (127 - image_clip - image_range) is shown in white.
