This demo features operations on various curious sound files.  It is 
controlled by the window in the upper right ("Sounds Demo Controls"). 

The bottom part of the control panel contains menus with the names of
various sounds.  Pop-down a menu with the right mouse button;
releasing the mouse when over a particular name will select it.  After
such a selection, the operation specified from the middle part of the
panel will be performed on the selected sound.

For example, if the "plot with spectrogram" button is down in the
middle panel, and if you select "kookaburra" from the animals menu in
the bottom panel, then three plots will be displayed: the time-domain
waveform, an FFT of short segment from the beginning of the waveform
(limits marked on the waveform), and a spectrogram.

The demo tries to set up the default D/A output according to what
hardware is available.  You can change this default by right-mousing
the "Setup Output" button.

When you have finished, press QUIT on the "Sounds Demo Controls" panel.
