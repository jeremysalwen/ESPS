# This file specifies many of the parameters for the program waves.
# Specifications take the form

# One or several of these pairs may appear on each line.  Lines in this
# file which begin with # are ignored.  The comments and blank lines seen here
# are optional and may be deleted in personalized copies.  A full set of
# specifications is included here as documentation, but any subset
# is acceptable.  If specifications are to be deleted, remove both the
# keyword and the value.  This file is accessed by get_globals() in globals.c.

# non-zero values for debug_level result in various debugging-related output 
# messages; higher values yield more messages
debug_level     0

# non-zero values for verbose results in assorted output messages that
# inform the user about what (x)waves+ is doing.  A value of 0 yields 
# silent operation.  The default level of 1 yields the following: 
# (1) startup messages (reporting on the profile that is read and 
# whether or not a DSP board has been detected); (2) the command lines
# of any external program calls caused by play, spectrogram, add_espsn, 
# add_espsf, add_espst, and shell commands; (3) the pid of any forked 
# process; (4) notification that a forked process has terminated.  
# If verbose is 2 or higher, you get all of the above, plus some details
# about waves+ command processing.

#xspectrum_datwin_x and xspectrum_datwin_y control the initial

#display object.  Positive values for xspectrum_datwin_x or
#xspectrum_datwin_y specify respectively the X and Y position of the
#xspectrum plot window if there is only one display object at the time
#the plot window is displayed.  If there is more than one display
#object, the xspectrum plot window is aligned with the first display
#window of the corresponding xwaves+ display object, with the xspectrum
#display directly underneath the left side of the xwaves+ window.  If
#xspectrum_data_win_x is negative, the top of all xspectrum plot
#windows is positioned directly underneath the first xwaves+ display
#window of the corresponding object.  If xspectrum_data_win_y is
#negative, the left side of all xspectrum plot windows is lined up
#(vertically) with the left side of the first xwaves+ display window of
#the corresponding object.
