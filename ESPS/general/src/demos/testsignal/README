This demo facilitates the generation and analysis of a noise-corrupted 
test signal.  

The demo tries to set up the default D/A output according to what
hardware is available.  You can change this default by right-mousing
the "Setup Output" button.

When the button "Generate New Test Signal" is pressed, you will 
be prompted for parameters that specify the test signal and additive 
noise.  The signal plus noise will then be displayed in xwaves+, 
together with corresponding spectrum analyzer and spectrogram displays.  

Besides xwaves+, the following ESPS programs are used behind the
scenes: mbuttons (for the "Test Signal Control" panel), xtext (for
displaying text output like this), xprompt (for the parameter
prompting), testsd (for generating the test signal and noise), addsd
(for creating the signal + noise), and send_xwaves (for sending
display commands to xwaves+).
