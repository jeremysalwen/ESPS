				Filters Demo

This demo shows one way in which ESPS filter design and filtering programs 
can be integrated with waves+. After pushing the demo button, two control 
panels and a time series display pop up. 

The little control panel allows you to quit the demo, see this file, configure
audio output, or view the files and scripts that comprise the demo. 

The longer control panel provides buttons for previewing filter responses 
(top row), adding filters to the waves+ menu (second row), and deleting 
filters (third row). The fourth row has buttons for modifying the mouse 
bindings and image presentations, running an interactive filter design
program to build a filter to apply to the data, and displaying the  sampled 
data file.

To use a filter on the sampled data, add it to the waves+ menus by pushing
the "Add ..." button for the filter you want (more than one can be added to 
the menu), move the mouse cursor into the data display, hold down the right 
mouse button, and release it on the item you added. Note the other items on 
the menu. You can move about in the data display by using the "zoom" items 
and the "window ahead" and "window back" items, play the data segment 
(if you have I/O), and do spectral analysis. To mark a sub-region of the 
display, hold the left mouse button down, drag it through the region of 
interest, and then release the mouse button.

You can custom design a filter to be used on the displayed signal.
By pressing the "Interactive Pole/Zero Filter Design" button, you can play with
a filter design program that allows you to place poles and zeros in the complex
Z-plane. A window for viewing spectral magnitude, spectral phase, impulse
response, etc. is present, and a window for editing an ascii version of the 
coefficients is available. Once a filter is designed, you can use it by 
selecting the "custom filter" item on the waves+ pull-down menu.
