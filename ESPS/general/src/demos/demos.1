.TH DEMOS 1\-ESPS 1.1
.SH NAME
demos - put up the button control panel for the demos
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B demos
[
.I " tmp_directory"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) pops up a push-button control panel containing a
\fIQUIT\fP
button and pull-down menu buttons for each demo.
By default,
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) 
creates a directory on /usr/tmp. Any files created by the
demos
go into this directory.
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) has an optional argument to allow
the user to specify the location of any output files; this directory
must be writable by the demo user.
.PP
A crude locking scheme is implemented to stop individual demos from
interfering with each other. You may need to manually remove a lock
file,
and start again under some circumstances. \fIdemos\fP(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)
will tell you the location of the lock file.
.PP
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) is intended to present some interesting
displays, show some applications of ESPS and
\fIwaves\fP+(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1),
and provide some examples of how to configured ESPS and \fIwaves\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)+ for different tasks.
.PP
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)
is a shell script that runs \fImbuttons\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) and
presents a button panel. Under each button is a shell script. These
shell scripts run ESPS and waves+ commands. 
If you do not have both ESPS and \fIwaves+\fP,
\fIdemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) will not work.
