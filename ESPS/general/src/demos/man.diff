.TH EDEMOS 1\-ESPS 1.5
.SH NAME
edemos \- put up a button control panel for various Entropic demos
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edemos
[
.I " tmp_directory"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIedemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) pops up a push-button control panel
containing a \fIQUIT\fP button and pull-down menu buttons for each
demo.  The various demos may create temporary output files.  By
default, \fIedemos\fP creates a temporary directory for these on
/usr/tmp.  The optional argument \fItmp_directory\fP may be used to
override the default and specify a directory for temporary files.  If
it exists, this directory must be writable by the demo user; if not,
\fIedemos\fP will try to create it.  Pressing the QUIT button on the
\fIedemos\fP control panel.  If a temp directory was selected by
\fIedemos\fP (i.e., if \fItmp_directory\fP was not specified),
\fIedemos\fP will remove the temporary directory provided that none of
the demos is running. If a demo is running, a pop-up window appears
with a message stating that the temporary directory was not removed.
If \fItmp_directory\fP was specified, no such removal or notice takes
place.
.PP
A crude locking scheme is implemented to stop individual demos from
interfering with each other, and to indicate whether it is safe to
remove the temporary directory.  You may need to manually remove a
lock file and start again under some circumstances.  A pop-up window
will report the location of the lock file.  
.PP
\fIedemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) is intended to present some interesting
displays, show some applications of ESPS and
\fIwaves\fP+(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1), and provide examples of how to
configured ESPS and \fIwaves\fP+ (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) for different
tasks.
.PP
\fIedemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) invokes a shell script that runs
\fImbuttons\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) and presents a button panel. Under
each button is a shell script. These shell scripts run ESPS and
\fIwaves\fP+ (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) commands.  If you do not have both ESPS
and \fIwaves+\fP, \fIedemos\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) will not work.
.PP
If an ESPS license is not checked out to the current host, \fIedemos\fP
will check one out.  No direct indication is given if the checkout fails 
(but various programs will report that a license has not been checkout out).  
.PP
Some of the demos provide audio output, if available, and try detect
and setup for support options (SPARCStation codec, AT&T Fab2 board, 
Ariel S-32C/Proport).  In these cases, a "Setup Audio" button-menu is 
provided to permit manual selection.  One of the choices is always 
"generic audio"; this is the option to choose if there is a program
called "play" somewhere on your path that "does the right thing"
(accepts an ESPS range option and file and plays the data).
