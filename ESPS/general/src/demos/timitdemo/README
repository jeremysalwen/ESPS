This demo features operations on the TIMIT database.

The demo tries to set up the default D/A output according to what
hardware is available.  You can change this default by right-mousing
the "Setup Output" button.

The bottom part of the control panel shows the prefix name of two 
files from the TIMIT database.  When you press one of these button, 
the operation selected in the middle part of the panel is performed
on the named file.
