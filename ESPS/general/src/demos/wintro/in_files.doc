			Input Files Control Panel
			-------------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The "Input Files" control panel contains a button for several different types
of data files. You can display a file by simply pushing one of the buttons.

Not that the "Speech Data" and "Speech Spectrogram" displays are related
(the spectrogram file is computed from the first second of the speech 
data file), and that cursors in the two displays are linked. Similarly,
the "Real" signal and spectrum displays are linked, and the "Complex"
signal and spectrum displays are linked.

To remove a display, either use the basic, window-manager supplied command,
or the "kill window" command in the waves+ display menu (hold right
mouse button down while in the data display).
