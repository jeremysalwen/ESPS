			The Menu Styles Control Panel
			-----------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
You may change the waves+ menus by using these buttons. "Waveform" displays
have one or more time series (connected points) in them, and "image" displays
have signal intensity represented by color or density of dots. These two 
display types can have pull-down menus that contain different operations,
or as in the default configuration here, the menus can be identical. The user
can decide on the menu configurations by use of startup  scripts, or
interactively change them by using the "Add Menu Function" buttons, as shown
here. This "Menu Styles" control panel provides access to a limited set of
display operations, and is for illustrative purposes only. You may add your 
own commands and many other ESPS and waves+ commands to the waves+ menus.

SELECT WAVEFORM MENU
--------------------
The "Select Waveform Menu" button allows you two choices of default menus and 
the ability to clear the waveform menu completely. See "Add Menu Function"
to rebuild your own waves+ pull-down menu.

SELECT IMAGE MENU
-----------------
The "Select Image Menu" button does the same thing as the "Select Waveform 
Menu", except it applies to image-style displays.

ADD MENU FUNCTION
-----------------
"Add Menu Function" adds commands to both the waveform and image menus. If
the command already exists on those menus, no action is taken. For example,
try selecting the "Segment statistics" command from this list of functions;
Now look at the bottom of the waves+ displaymenus; you should see it there.

ADD IMAGE MENU FUNCTION
-----------------------
You can selectively add commands to only waveform or only image display menus,
and "Add Image Menu Function" provides one example adding a command to
an image menu. Try adding the 3D Plot command, and using it on the 
"Image Display" found on the "Input Files" control panel.
