			Color Support Control Panel
			---------------------------

SET COLOR MAP
------------
The "Color Support" control panel provides access to several
colormaps for use with waves+. These colormaps are available
via a pull-down menu on the screen button "Set Color Map" (hold 
right mouse down while over button).

SHOW COLOR SCALE
----------------
The "Color Scale" button pops up a display that shows the relationship
between the colors and their dB values. To change the threshold (lowest
level in the colormap) and the range (number of dB above threshold
to use in the display), place the mouse cursor in the lower left of
an image display, hold the middle mouse button down, and move up 
toward the right corner. This can be done in all image-style displays.
