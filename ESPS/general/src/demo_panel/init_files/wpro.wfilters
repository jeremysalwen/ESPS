# This file specifies many of the parameters for the program waves.
# Specifications take the form
#		key_word <value>
# One or several of these pairs may appear on each line.  Lines in this
# file which begin with # are ignored.  The comments and blank lines seen here
# are optional and may be deleted in personalized copies.  A full set of
# specifications is included here as documentation, but any subset
# is acceptable.  If specifications are to be deleted, remove both the
# keyword and the value.  This file is accessed by get_globals() in globals.c.
