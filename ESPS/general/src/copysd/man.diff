.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Copysd
copies selected portions of sampled data files into a new sampled data
file.  In addition to the range of points that are copied,
.I copysd
allows the user to change the data type as well as to apply
multiplicative and additive scale factors.  Allowable output data
types that can be specified are bytes, shorts, longs, float, 
double, byte_cplx, short_cplx, long_cplx, float_cplx, and
double_cplx; the default data type of the output file is that of the first
input file.
.PP
If an input file name is "-", stdin is read; similarly,
if
.I outfile
is "-", the output is written to stdout.  If only a single
input file is involved, it may be omitted from the command line, in
which case 
.I copysd
gets its name from ESPS Common (see EXAMPLES).  
.PP
When a floating type is converted to an integer type,
the values are rounded.
When a complex type is converted to a real type,
the imaginary part is discarded.
Values that are too large to represent in the output data type are
clipped, and no warning is given.
.PP
For appending to an existing FEA_SD file, use \fIcopysps\fP
(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).  
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-a " add_constant \fR[0]\fP"
The argument \fIadd_constant\fP is a float value that is added 
to samples before they are written to the output.
.TP
.BI \-d " data_type"
The argument representing the desired
output data type in \fIoutfile\fP :
byte, short, long, float, double, byte_cplx, short_cplx, long_cplx,
float_cplx, and double_cplx.
.TP
.B \-g
By default, generic header items are not copied from the input files to
the output file, except for \fIrecord_freq\fR.  The item
\fIstart_time\fR is computed and filled in.   If the \fB-g\fR option is
used, then all generic are copied from the first input file to the
output file.  Note that this might result in some of these values not
being valid over the range of data copied.   This program has no way of
knowing the semantics of generic header items.   
.TP
.B \-o
Normally the ESPS headers from the input files are
copied into the header of the new output file as source files.
If the
.B \-o
is specified, the input files' headers are not stored in the output file.
.TP
.BI \-p " range"
\fB\-p\fP is a synonym for \fB\-r\fP.
.TP
.BI \-r " first:last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first:+incr
Determines the range of points to be copied from each input file
(same range for all input files).  In the first form, a pair of
unsigned integers gives the first and last points of the range.  If
.I first
is omitted, 1 is used.  If 
.I last 
is omitted, the last point in the file is used.  The second form is
equivalent to the first with 
.I "last = first + incr".
To specify a range in seconds, use \fB\-S\fP (see below)
instead of \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-p\fP.
.TP
.BI \-s " scale \fR[1]\fP"
The argument \fIscale\fP is a float value by which the input samples
are multiplied before being written to the output.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
If \fIdebug_level\fP is positive, \fIcopysd\fP prints progress and
diagnostic messages.  Debug levels 1-3 are defined \- the higher the
number, the more verbose the messages.  The default level is zero,
which causes no debug output.
.TP
.BI \-S " start_time:end_time"
.TP
.BI \-S " start_time:+time_incr"
\fB-S\fP is similar to \fB-p\fP and \fB-r\fP, except that the 
range limits are interpreted as times (in seconds).  If
\fIstart_time\fP is omitted, it is set to the value of the 
\fIstart_time\fP generic header item.  If \fIend_time\fP 
is omitted, it is set to the time corresponding to the end of the file.  
No more than one of the options \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-r\fP, and \fB\-S\fP
should be used.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
The parameter file is not read.  
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.PP
The following items are read from the ESPS Common File provided that
only one input file or no input file is given on the command line and
provided that standard input isn't used.  
.IP
.I "filename - string"
.IP
This is the name of the input file.  If no input file is 
specified on the command line, \fIfilename\fP is taken to be the
input file.  If an input file is specified on the command line, 
that input file name must match \fIfilename\fP or the other 
items (below) are not read from Common. 
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
This is the starting point in the input file to begin copying.
It is not read if the \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-r\fP, or \fB\-S\fP option is used.  
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
This is the number of points to copy from the input file.
It is not read if the \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-r\fP, or \fB\-S\fP option is used.
A value of zero means the last point in the file.
.sp
.PP
Again, the values of \fIstart\fR and \fInan\fR are only used if the
input file on the command line is the same as \fIfilename\fP in the
common file, or if no input file was given on the command line.  If
\fIstart\fR and/or \fInan\fR are not given in the common file, or if
the common file can't be opened for reading, then \fIstart\fR
defaults to the beginning of the file and \fInan\fR defaults to the
number of points in the file.
.PP
The following items are written into the ESPS Common file:
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The starting point from the input file.
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The number of points in the selected range.
.sp
.I "prog - string"
.IP
This is the name of the program (\fIcopysd\fP in this case).
.sp
.I "filename - string"
.IP
The name of the input file.  If multiple input files are processed, this
is the name of the first file.   
.PP
These items are not written to ESPS COMMON if the output file is <stdout>.
.SH "ESPS HEADERS"
.PP
Items in the FEA_SD header of \fIoutfile\fP are set as follows:
.IP
.nf
.IR record_freq " = sampling frequency of input files (must be same in all)
.fi
.PP
The generic header item \fIstart_time\fP (type DOUBLE) is written in
the output file.  The value written is computed by taking the
\fIstart_time\fP value from the header of the first input file (or
zero, if such a header item doesn't exist) and adding to it the offset
time (from the beginning of the first input file) of the first point
copied.  If the \fB-s\fP option is used, the corresponding \fIscale\fP
is written as the generic \fIscale_factor\fP.  If the \fB-a\fP option
is used, the corresponding \fIadd_constant\fP is written as the
generic \fIadd_constant\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
In this example, a range of sampled data is selected from a plot of
\fIfile.sd\fP and then copied to another file \fIsegment.sd\fP
(\fIcopysd\fP gets the file name and range from ESPS Common):
.nf

    %plotsd file.sd
    %range
    %copysd segment.sd

.fi
.PP
In this example, some Gaussian noise is added to an existing 
file \fId1.sd\fP, and the results are copied, together with 
the contents of two other sampled data files, to the file
\fIcombined.sd\fP:
.nf

    %testd -Tgauss - | addsd - d1.sd - | copysd - d2.sd d3.sd combined.sd

.fi

.fi
.SH BUGS
.PP
It would have been better if \fB-S\fP had been lower case (consistent
with other ESPS programs), but we left \fB-s\fP for scaling so as to
not break old programs.  The result is error prone.  As a precaution,
a warning message is issued if a ':' is used in the argument to
\fB-s\fP.
