     _P_w_r accepts a FEA file _i_n_p_u_t containing  a  vector  sampled-
     data  field  in  each  record  (there may be other fields as
     well).  It produces a FEA file _o_u_t_p_u_t with records  contain-
     ing  the  raw  power  (or log raw power) of the sampled-data
     field from that record.  Each field of sampled data  may  be
     thought  of  as  a  separate frame of data, such as might be
     produced by _f_r_a_m_e (1-ESPS).  The default name for  the  sam-
     pled data field in _i_n_p_u_t is _s_d, and the default name for the
     power field in _o_u_t_p_u_t is _r_a_w__p_o_w_e_r (_l_o_g__p_o_w_e_r if  ----llll  option
     used).  Both  defaults  can  be  changed  by means of the ----ffff
     option.  If _i_n_p_u_t is "-", standard input  is  used  for  the
     input  file.   If  _o_u_t_p_u_t is "-", standard input is used for
     the output file.

     The power is computed by summing the squares of the  sampled
     data  values  and  dividing  by  the number of points in the
     frame.  If _i_n_p_u_t is not a segment-labelled FEA file (see FEA
     (5 - ESPS)),  the frame is considered to comprise all of the
     points in the sampled data field, so the frame length  is  a
     constant  set  to  the size of the sampled data field (which
     can be determined  from  the  file  header).   If  _i_n_p_u_t  is
     segment-labelled,  the  size  of  the  sampled data field is
     really a maximum size, and the frame size for  a  particular
     record  is  given by the _s_e_g_m_e_n_t__l_e_n_g_t_h field (this field is
     always  present  in  segment-labelled  files).   Thus,   for
     segment-labelled  files,  the frame from any input record is
     the first _s_e_g_m_e_n_t__l_e_n_g_t_h points of the sampled data field.

     If the ----llll is used, the (base 10) log of  the  raw  power  is
     stored  in  the output file instead of the raw power itself.
     To avoid computational overflow,  logs  are  not  taken  for
     power  values  less  than 10/DBL_MAX; in these cases the log
     power stored is log10(10/DBL_MAX),  which  is  approximately
     -307.55.

     The following options are supported:

     ----llll    Specifies that the log (base 10) of the raw  power  be
          computed  instead  of the raw power.  If this option is
          used, the default name for the output  power  field  is
          _l_o_g__p_o_w_e_r; this name can be changed via the ----ffff option.

     ----rrrr _s_t_a_r_t::::++++_n_a_n
          In the first form, a pair of unsigned  integers  speci-
          fies  the  range  of  records  to be processed.  Either
          _s_t_a_r_t or _l_a_s_t may be omitted; then the default value is
          used.  If _l_a_s_t = _s_t_a_r_t + _n_a_n, the second form (with the
          plus sign) specifies the same range as the first.   The
          ---- rrrr  overrides  the  values  of  _s_t_a_r_t and _n_a_n from the
          parameter file.

     ----ffff _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e
          If this option is used once, it specifies the  name  of
          the  sampled data field in _i_n_p_u_t.  If it is used twice,
          the second time it specifies  the  name  of  the  power
          field  in  _o_u_t_p_u_t.   The default names for these fields
          are "sd"  and  "raw_power",  respectively.  If  the  ----llll
          option is used, the default name for the power field is
          "log_power".

     The parameter file does not have to be  present,  since  all
     the  parameters  have default values.  The following parame-
     ters are read, if present, from the parameter file:

          _s_d__f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          This is the name of the sampled data  field  in  _i_n_p_u_t.
          The  default  is  "sd".   A  paramter  file  value  (if
          present) is overidden by  the  first  use  of  the  ---- ffff
          option.

          _p_o_w_e_r__f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          This is the name of the raw power field in _o_u_t_p_u_t.  The
          default  is  "raw_power".   A  parameter file value (if
          present) is overidden by the  second  use  of  the  ---- ffff
          option.

          _p_o_w_e_r__f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          This is the function to apply to value of the raw power
          before  storing  in  the  output  file.  The default is
          "none", which means that the output file is to  contain
          the  raw  power value.  The only other recognized value
          is "log", which means that the output file is  to  con-
          tain the log of the raw power.

          This is the first record  of  _i_n_p_u_t  to  process.   The
          default is 1.  It is not read if the ----rrrr option is used.

          _n_a_n - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          This is the number of records to process.   It  is  not
          read  if  the ----rrrr option is used.  A value of zero means
          all  subsequent  records  in  the  file;  this  is  the
          default.

     Remember that command line option values override  parameter
     file values.

     ESPS Common  processing  may  be  disabled  by  setting  the
     environment  variable USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default
     ESPS Common file is .espscom in the user's  home  directory.
     This  may  be  overidden by setting the environment variable
     ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of  Common  pro-
     cessing   is   determined   by   the   environment  variable
     ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no feedback and increasing lev-
     els causing increasingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE
     is not defined, a default value of 3 is assumed.

     ESPS Common is not processed by _p_w_r  if  _i_n_p_u_t  is  standard
     input.   Otherwise,  provided  that the Common file is newer
     than the parameter file,  and  provided  that  the  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     entry  in  Common matches _i_n_p_u_t, the Common values for _s_t_a_r_t
     and _n_a_n override those that may be present in the  parameter
     file.

     The following items are written into the  ESPS  Common  file
     provided that _o_u_t_p_u_t is not <stdout>.

          _s_t_a_r_t - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The starting record from the input file.

          _n_a_n - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The number of records in the selected range.

          _p_r_o_g - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          This is the name of the program (_p_w_r in this case).

          _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          The name of the input file _i_n_p_u_t.

     The _o_u_t_p_u_t header is a new FEA file header.  If the  generic
     header item _s_r_c__s_f exists in the input file, it is copied to
     the output file.  The items _s_t_a_r_t and  _n_a_n  are  written  to
     contain  the  starting  record  number and number of records
     processed.

     The size of the input sampled data field is written  to  the
     generic _f_r_m_l_e_n.

     The generic header item _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e is written in the  output
     file.    The   value  written  is  computed  by  taking  the
     _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e value from the header of the input file (or zero,
     if such a header item doesn't exist), adding to it the rela-
     tive time from the first record in the  file  to  the  first
     record processed, and adding a displacement corresponding to
     half of _f_r_m_l_e_n.  The computation of  _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e  depends  on
     the  value  of  the  generic header item _s_r_c__s_f in the input
     file (which is assumed to be the sampling rate of the actual
     data   in  each  field).   If  this  item  is  not  present,
     _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e is just copied from the input file to the  output
     file.

     As usual, the command line is added as  a  comment  and  the
     header  of  _i_n_p_u_t  is  added  as  a  source  file to _o_u_t_p_u_t.
     Another comment gives the name of the field added by _p_w_r.
