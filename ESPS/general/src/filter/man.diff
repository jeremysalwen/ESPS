.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.mc |
This program is considered obsolete and will be eliminated in future
next Entropic software releases and replaced by the new program,
currently called \fIfilter2\fR.  See the manual entry for \fIfilter2\fR.
.mc
.PP
.mc |
The program
.I filter
takes the input sampled data file,
.I in_file,
and produces an output sampled data file,
.I out_file,
after performing a digital filtering operation on it.
The output sampled data file is of type FEA_SD (5\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).
\fIFilter\fR allows the user to change the data type of the output file
by using the \fB\-d\fR option; see below for more details.
The program accepts "\-" for either the input file or the output file
to use the standard input and standard output, respectively. 
.mc
.PP
.mc |
The program may implement either finite impulse response (FIR) or
infinite impulse response (IIR) filters.
A set of numerator coefficients and (optionally) a set of denominator coefficients are specified either in the parameter file or in the FEAFILT file.  Currently, only real filters
may be used; if a filter is complex, it's imaginary part is ignored.
The numerator coefficients then become the {a\di\u} and the denominator
coefficients become the {b\di\u} in the following
z-domain transfer function:
.nf

        
                       a\d0\u + a\d1\uz\u-1\d + a\d2\uz\u-2\d + ... + a\dm-1\uz\u-m+1\d
        H(z)  =   ___________________________________

                       b\d0\u + b\d1\uz\u-1\d + b\d2\uz\u-2\d + ... + b\dn-1\uz\u-n+1\d


.fi
An FIR filter corresponds to the case where, in the equation above, b\d0\u = n = 1.
An FIR filter may also be specified by choosing the order of the denominator
to be zero, and entering no denominator coefficients at all.
.mc
.PP
.mc |
The program uses a different initialization procedure for FIR filters
than it uses for IIR filters. 
For FIR filtering, the first output will be computed from data samples
occurring before the starting point in the input file (as defined by the parameter
.I start
, for example), if they exist.  Data samples which would occur before
the first sample in the input file are assumed to be zero.
For IIR filtering, all inputs and outputs occurring before the starting
point are assumed to be zero.
.mc
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file"
uses the parameter file 
.mc |
.I param_fil
rather than the default, which is
.I params.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-r " range"
Perform the filtering operation on the specified range of points.
.I range
is a character string which is interpreted in the format
understood by
.I range_switch (3-ESPSu).
\fBr\fP and \fBp\fP are synonyms.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-p " range"
Perform the filtering operation on the specified range of points.
.I range
is a character string which is interpreted in the format
understood by
.I range_switch (3-ESPSu).
\fB\-r\fP is a synonym for \fB\-p\fP.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-d " data_type"
The argument \fIdata_type\fR is a character representing
the desired output data type in \fIout_file\fR: \fIb\fR for byte,
\fIs\fR for short, \fIl\fR for long, \fIf\fR for float, and \fId\fR
for double. This data type conversion is often
useful when the input data type is short and the filtering operation
produces sample values greater in magnitude than 2\u15\d . The output type 
is real or complex in agreement with the input type; for example if
\fId\fP is specified, the output type is DOUBLE if the input is
real and DOUBLE_CPLX if the input is complex.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-f " filtername"
.mc
If the coefficients are being read from the parameter file, then
.mc |
.I filtername
is the body of the name of the variable that contains
the number of coefficients and the actual coefficients.
This means that the coefficients will be
found in the arrays
.I filtername_num
and
.I filtername_den
and the size of those arrays will be specified by
.I filtername_nsiz
and
.I filtername_dsiz,
respectively.
The default name in this case is
.I filter.
.mc
.IP
If the coefficients are being read from a FEAFILT file, then
.mc |
.I filtername
is the number of the filter record to use.
.mc
The default name in this case is 1, the first record in the file.
.mc |
.br
.mc
.TP
.BI \-F " filt_file"
.mc |
Read the coefficients from the FEAFILT file
.I filt_file
.mc
rather than from the parameter file.
.mc |
In this case the header of 
.I filt_file
is added to the header of the program output as a source file.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-x " debug_level"
A value of zero (the default value) will cause
.I filter
to do its work silently, unless there is an error.
A nonzero value will cause various parameters to be printed out
during program initialization.
.br
.mc
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-i " up/down"
Perform interpolation filtering such that the output sampling rate is
equal to 
.I (src_sf)*(up/down).
Both 
.I up
and
.I down
are integers.
Effectively, the program increases the sampling rate to
.I up*(src_sf),
filters this signal with the specified filter, and then downsamples the
resulting signal by a factor of
.I down.
.TP
.BI \-z
By specifying \fB\-z\fP,
the \fIstart_time\fP generic value is reduced by the value of the
\fIdelay_samples\fP generic header value, if it exists. 
.mc
This often helps time align a filtered
.mc |
signal with the input signal. 
Note that
if \fIdelay_samples\fP is not defined in the input file header,
a value of 0 is assumed.
.sp
.mc
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.mc |
.PP
The values of parameters obtained from the parameter file are printed
if the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE is 3 or greater.  The default
value is 3.
.PP
.mc
The following parameters are read from the parameter file:
.mc |
.IP
.I "start \- integer"
.IP
.mc
The first point in the input sampled data file that is processed.
The samples are assumed to be numbered starting with one so that
.mc |
setting 
.I "start = 1"
will cause processing to begin with the first sample.
.sp
.I "nan \- integer"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
The number of points in the sampled data file to process.
.sp
.I "filtername_nsiz \- integer"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
The number of numerator coefficients in the transfer function for the filter
.I filtername.
.sp
.I "filtername_dsiz \- integer"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
The number of denominator coefficients in the transfer function for the filter
.I filtername.
A value of zero means that a denominator coefficient array need not be
entered.
.sp
.I "filtername_num \- float array"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
The numerator coefficients.  They are specified in order starting with
a\d0\u.
.mc
.sp
.mc |
.I "filtername_den \- float array"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
The denominator coefficients.  They are specified in order starting with
b\d0\u.
.mc
.sp
.mc |
.SH ESPS COMMON
If the input
is standard input, COMMON is not read. 
The following items may be read from COMMON:
.IP
.I "filename \- string"
.IP
This is the name of the input file. If the command line specifies only one 
filename, it is assumed to be the output filename and COMMON is read 
to get the input filename. If the input filename is specified on the
command line, it must match \fIfilename\fR in COMMON or the other
items (below) are not read.
.IP
.I "start \- integer"
.IP
This is the starting point in the input file.
.IP
.I "nan \- integer"
.IP
This is the number of points to process. 
.mc
.PP
.mc |
If the output is standard output,
COMMON is not written.
Otherwise the following items are written to COMMON.
.mc
.IP
.mc |
.I "filename \- string"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
This is the name of the output file.
.mc
.IP
.mc |
.I "start \- integer"
.mc
.IP
.mc |
This is the starting point in the output file
and is always equal to one.
.IP
.I "nan \- integer"
.IP
This is the number of points in the output file.
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.mc
.sp
.SH ESPS HEADER
.mc |
The file header of
.I out_file
will contain mostly the same information as is contained in that of
.I in_file,
except where they are altered by the parameters in the parameter file.
The -i option changes the
.I record_freq
header item.
The filter coefficients will be stored in the output header as the
.I filter
zfunc.
.mc
.PP
.mc |
A generic header item \fIstart_time\fR (type DOUBLE), is added
to the output file header. It contains the starting time in seconds of the
first point in the output file. This start time is relative to the original
sampled data file. This means that if the input file has a \fIstart_time\fR
generic in it, the output file's \fIstart_time\fR value is computed
relative to the input file's \fIstart_time\fR. Also see the \fB\-z\fP
option.
.mc
.PP
.mc |
For example, if the input file has a \fIstart_time\fR = 1.0 seconds,
the input file's sampling frequency = 8000 samples/second, and the 
starting point in the input file = 2000, the output file's 
\fIstart_time\fR = 1.0 + 2000/8000 = 1.25 seconds.
