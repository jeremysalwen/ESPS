     _M_e__s_g_r_a_m reads an ESPS sampled data file, pre-emphasizes it,
     and  produces  an ESPS FEA_SPEC(5-ESPS) file, which qresults
     from maximum entropy spectral analysis.  This file is  suit-
     able for displaying as a speech spectrogram.  (See _p_l_o_t_s_g_r_a_m
     (1-ESPS).)  By default (specifying no options) or by  speci-
     fying  _w_b  for  the  ----mmmm option, _m_e__s_g_r_a_m produces a FEA_SPEC
     file that simulates the analysis done to produce a wide-band
     speech spectrogram.  Alternatively, by specifying _n_b for the
     ----mmmm option, a FEA_SPEC file that simulates the analysis for a
     narrow-band  spectrogram  is computed.  The ----mmmm option simply
     defines different defaults for the other options.  By speci-
     fying  any  of  the  other  options,  in addition to ----mmmm, the
     default  values  are  overridden  by  the  specified  option
     values.   This allows the user to alter the basic display to
     highlight facets of the spectrogram that are  of  particular
     interest.

     _m_e__s_g_r_a_m is a shell script that makes  use  of  _f_i_l_t_e_r  (1 -
     ESPS),  _r_e_f_c_o_f (1-ESPS), and _m_e__s_p_e_c (1-ESPS); the parameter
     file is processed using _g_e_t_p_a_r_a_m (1-ESPS).

     If "-" is specified for the output file, standard output  is
     used.  Note, standard input cannot be read by this script.

          Determines the range in seconds in the input file  over
          which  the  spectrogram  values are to be computed.  In
          the first form, a pair of real numbers gives the start-
          ing  and ending times of the range.  The correspondence
          between samples and times is determined by two  quanti-
          ties:   the  starting time of the file and the interval
          between samples.  The former is given  by  the  generic
          header item _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e in the input file, or 0.0 if the
          header item is not present.  The latter is the recipro-
          cal  of  the  sample frequency _s_f in the type-dependent
          part of the SD header.  If _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e is  omitted,  the
          starting  time  of  the  file  is used.  If _e_n_d__t_i_m_e is

          Determines the range in points in the input  file  over
          which  the  spectrogram  values are to be computed.  In
          the first form, a pair of unsigned integers  gives  the
          first and last points of the range, counting from 1 for
          the first point in the file.  If first is omitted, 1 is
          used.  If last is omitted, the range extends to the end
          of the file.  The second  form  is  equivalent  to  the
          first with last = first + incr . This option should not
          be specified if -s is specified.

     ----rrrr _r_a_n_g_e
          ----rrrr is a synonym for ----pppp.

          The basic method is specified here. There are two  pos-
          sible values:  _w_b for wide band and _n_b for narrow band.
          By  specifying  _w_b,  the  following  values  are   set:
          lpc_method  = fburg, pre-emphasis = .94, analysis_order
          = 10, window_len = 8 msec., step_size =  2  msec.,  and
          data_window  =  RECT.   By specifying _n_b, the following
          values are set: lpc_method = fburg, pre-emphasis = .94,
          analysis_order = 10, window_len = 40 msec., step_size =
          2 msec., and data_window = RECT.

     ----aaaa _l_p_c__m_e_t_h_o_d [fburg]
          Specifies the spectrum analysis method.  The default is
          the  fast  modified Burg ("fburg") method.  Also avail-
          able are the autocorrelation method  "autoc"),  covari-
          ance  method  ("cov"),  Burg  method ("burg"), modified
          Burg method ("mburg"), stuctured  covariance  ("strcov"
          and "strcov1"), and vector Burg ("vburg", fast approxi-
          mation to structured covariance.  Of the two structured
          covariance methods, the first ("strcov" is considerably
          faster and  better  behaved;  "strcov1"  is  older  but
          included  as  it  may  prove useful on occasion.  ** If
          "strcov"  is  used,  the  ----cccc  and  ----iiii  options   become
          relevant.   The  ----mmmm option overrides the value that may
          be in the parameter file.

     ----cccc _c_o_n_v__t_e_s_t[1e-5]
          Specifies, for the STRCOV method  only  (not  including
          STRCOV1),  a  convergence  test  value.   The lower the
          value, the smaller the change required on  each  itera-
          tion  before  the  estimator  terminates,  and the more
          iterations that normally will result.

     ----iiii _m_a_x__i_t_e_r[20]
          Specifies, for the STRCOV method  only  (not  including
          STRCOV1),  the  maximum  number  of iterations that the
          estimator will run through before terminating.  A warn-
          ing  will  indicate if the estimator terminates because
          max_iter has been exceeded.

     ----wwww _w_i_n_d_o_w__l_e_n
          The duration of data in milliseconds over which the the
          power spectrum is computed for each column of the spec-
          trogram. The analysis bandwidth  is  inversely  propor-
          tional to this value.

     ----EEEE _p_r_e__e_m_p_h_a_s_i_s
          The coefficient _A in the pre-emphasis filter: 1 -  _A/z.
          This  filter is applied to the sampled data before com-
          puting the power spectrum. A value of _A = 1 provides  a
          6 dB/octave boost to the high frequencies; a value of 0
          provides no boost.

     ----oooo _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s__o_r_d_e_r
          The number of parameters in  the  autoregressive  model
          that is used to compute the power spectrum.

     ----SSSS _s_t_e_p__s_i_z_e
          The time step in milliseconds between  columns  in  the
          spectrogram.   The  time resolution and horizontal mag-
          nification are affected by this parameter.

     ----dddd _d_a_t_a__w_i_n_d_o_w
          The data window applied to the data before the computa-
          tion  of the power spectrogram. Possible values include
          RECT (rectangular), HAMMING, and  TRIANG  (triangular).
          See  _w_i_n_d_o_w  (3 -ESPS) for a complete list of supported
          data windows.

          containing  1s  and  0s intended for display as a simu-
          lated gray-scale spectrogram on a black-and-white moni-
          tor.   The  _r_e_f_c_o_f (1-ESPS) output is piped through the
          _d_i_t_h_e_r(1-ESPS) program.

     The parameter file is not required to be present,  as  there
     are  default  parameter values that apply.  If the parameter
     file does exist, the following parameters are read:

     _m_e_t_h_o_d - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The spectrogram method to use.  This parameter  is  not
          read  if  the  ----mmmm  option is used.  If the parameter is
          present and is read, it determines default  values  for
          all  other parameters as discussed under the ----mmmm option.

          The other parameters  (or  command  line  options),  if
          present,   override  these  defaults.   The  choice  of
          "other" uses defaults that are the same as "wb".

     _l_p_c__m_e_t_h_o_d - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The analysis method used to compute reflection  coeffi-
          cients.  This parameter is not read if the ----aaaa is used.

     _d_a_t_a__w_i_n_d_o_w - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The data window to apply to the data.   This  parameter
          is  not read if the ----dddd option is specified or if _m_e_t_h_o_d
          is in the parameter file and does not  have  the  value
          "other".   Acceptable  values include "RECT" for a rec-
          tangular window, "HAMMING", for Hamming, "HANNING"  for
          Hanning,  "COS4" for cosine 4th, and "TRIANG", for tri-
          angular; see the _w_i_n_d_o_w(3-ESPSsp) manual page  for  the
          complete list.

     _s_t_a_r_t - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The first point in the input sampled data file that  is
          processed.   A  value  of 1 denotes the first sample in
          the file.  This parameter is not read  if  any  of  the
          range  command  line options are used.  If it is not in
          the parameter file, and neither option is specified,  a
          default value of 1 is used.

     _n_a_n - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The total number of data points to process.  If _n_a_n  is
          0,  processing  continues  through the end of the file.
          This parameter is not read if any of the range  command
          line options are used.

     _w_i_n_d_o_w__l_e_n - _f_l_o_a_t

          The duration in milliseconds of each frame. This param-
          eter  not  read  if  the  ----wwww  option is specified of if
          _m_e_t_h_o_d is in the file  and  does  not  have  the  value
          "other".

     _p_r_e__e_m_p_h_a_s_i_s - _f_l_o_a_t
          The coefficient in the preemphasis filter (see  ---- EEEE  in
          the Options section). This parameter not read if the ----EEEE
          option is specified.

     _s_t_e_p__s_i_z_e - _f_l_o_a_t
          Initial points of consecutive  frames  differ  by  this
          number of milliseconds.  This parameter not read if the
          ----SSSS option is specified.

          The number of reflection coefficients computed for each
          frame of input data.  If no value is given in the file,
          a default value of 15 is used.  This value is not  read
          if the command line option ----oooo is used.

     _s_t_r_c_o_v__t_e_s_t - _f_l_o_a_t

          If STRCOV is used, this is the convergence  test  value
          (the lower the value, the smaller the change per itera-
          tion before termination). This is not  read  if  ----cccc  is
          used.

     _s_t_r_c_o_v__m_a_x_i_t_e_r - _i_n_t

          If STRCOV is used, this is the maximum number of itera-
          tions allowed before the estimator terminates.  This is
          not read if ----iiii is used.

     The values of parameters obtained from  the  parameter  file
     are printed if the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE is 3 or
     greater.  The default value is 3.

     ESPS Common is  read  provided  that  Common  processing  is
     enabled  and  that  the  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  entry  in  Common matches
     _i_n_p_u_t._S_D, in which case parameters present in  Common  over-
     ride  values  from  the parameter file, which in turn may be
     overriden by command line options  (see  the  discussion  in
     ESPS  PARAMETERS  and under each option).  Common processing
     is useful when _r_a_n_g_e (1-ESPS) is used to  select  a  segment
     from  _f_i_l_e._s_d.  Common  is  not  read if _f_i_l_e._s_d is standard
     input. If _f_i_l_e._r_c is not standard output and _f_i_l_e._s_d is  not
     standard  input, the Common parameters _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e (= file.sd),
     _p_r_o_g (= refcof), _s_t_a_r_t, and _n_a_n are written to ESPS Common.

     ESPS Common  processing  may  be  disabled  by  setting  the
     environment  variable USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default
     ESPS Common file is setting the environment variable ESPSCOM
     to  the desired path.  User feedback of Common processing is
     determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE, with  0
     causing  no  feedback and increasing levels causing increas-
     ingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined,  a
     default value of 3 is assumed.

     The generic header item _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e (type DOUBLE) is  written
     in the output file.  The value written is computed by taking
     the _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e value from the header of the input  file  (or
     zero,  if such a header item doesn't exist) and adding to it
     the offset time (from the beginning of the  input  file)  of
