.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fICbkd\fP reads a vector quantizer codebook,
finds the distances between the codewords, and forms a table
of the distances.  This allows quick computation of distances
when processing quantized data.
.PP
Codebooks are read from the FEA_VQ (5-ESPS) file \fIcbk_in\fP,
and the euclidean
distances between the codewords are found and are written to the FEA_VQ
file \fIcbk_out\fP. 
For each codebook in the specified input file records, an array
\fBtable\fP, of size \fBcurrent_size x current_size\fP is formed,
where \fBcurrent_size\fP is the number of words in the codebook.
Element \fBtable[i][j]\fP is the distance between codewords \fBi\fP
and \fBj\fP.
The specified records of the input file are copied to the
output file and the distance data is stored in the 
\fBdesign_size\fP x \fBdesign_size\fP dimensional field
\fItable_field\fP. By default, codebooks are read from all records in \fIcbk_in\fP
and the corresponding distance tables are written to the same records
in \fIcbk_out\fP  (see the \fB\-r\fP option).
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param"
Uses the parameter file \fIparam\fP, rather than the default, which is \fIparams\fP. 
.TP
.BI \-r " first":"last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first\-last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first" :+ "incr" 
In the first two forms, a pair of unsigned integers specifies the
range of records from \fIcbk_in\fP to process.  
If \fIlast\fP = \fIfirst\fP + \fInan\fP, the last form specifies the
same range as the first.  If \fIfirst\fP is omitted, the default value
1 is used. If \fIlast\fP is omitted, the default is to process all
records from \fIstart\fP to the last in the file.  This option
overides the values of \fIstart\fP and \fInan\fP in the parameter file.
.TP
.BI \-t " table_field"
Name of the field in the FEA_VQ file \fIcbk_out\fP which will
contain the codeword distance table.  By default, this field name
is "distance_table".
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
A positive value causes debugging output to be printed on the standard
error output. Larger values give more output.  The default is 0, for
no output.
.sp
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The parameter file is not required to be present; there are default
values which will apply.  If the parameter file does exist, the following
parameters are read:
.TP
.I start - integer
The first record in the input FEA_VQ file for which the codebook
distances are computed and written to the FEA_VQ output file.  
This parameter is not used if the \fB\-r\fP option
is used.  If \fIstart\fP is not specified and \fB\-r\fP is not used,
the default is to begin processing at the first record in the input
file. 
.TP
.I nan - integer
The number of records from the input FEA_VQ file to process. This
parameter is not used if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.  If \fInan\fP
is not specified and \fB\-r\fP is not used, the default is to process
all records of \fIcbk_in\fP from \fIstart\fP to the last record in
the file.
.TP
.I table_field - string 
Name of the field in the FEA_VQ file \fIcbk_out\fP which will
contain the codeword distance table.  See the \fB\-t\fP option; this
paramter is not read if the \fB\-t\fP option is used.
.TP
.I debug_level - int
A positive value causes debugging output to be printed on the standard
error output.  Larger values give more output.  The default is 0, for
no output.  This parameter is not read if the \fB\-t\fP option is used.
.sp
.SH ESPS COMMON
ESPS Common is not read or written.
.sp
.SH ESPS HEADER
\fICbkd\fP copies the FEA_VQ file header of \fIcbk_in\fP 
as the header of \fIcbk_out\fP.  
The input line is added as a comment and \fIcbk_in\fP
is added as a source.
.PP
The contents of the FEA_VQ records of \fIcbk_in\fP are copied to 
\fIcbk_out\fP and the field \fIdistance_table\fP is
created; \fIdistance_table\fP contains the distances between codewords
and is a two dimension field of data type DOUBLE and 
contains \fBdesign_size x design_size\fP elements.
