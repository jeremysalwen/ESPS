     _M_e__s_p_e_c reads spectral parameters and other information from
     the input file and generates a corresponding spectral record
     file containing  logarithmically  scaled  (in  dB)  maximum-
     entropy spectral power densities.

     The spectral  parameters  may  be  reflection  coefficients,
     autoregressive-filter  coefficients, or any of several other
     types of parameters; see _s_p_e_c__r_e_p in the Parameters  section
     and the documentation for reps_rc(3-ESPS) for a list.  Other
     required information includes the total power, the order  of
     the  spectrum,  and  the  sampling  frequency.  These may be
     obtained from the input file, or defaults may be  used;  see
     the    descriptions    of    the    parameters    _m_a_x__o_r_d_e_r,
     _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q__n_a_m_e, _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q, _p_o_w_e_r__f_i_e_l_d, and _p_o_w_e_r. FEA_ANA(5
     - ESPS)  files  are suitable as input and are specially pro-
     vided for, but any vector field of type  _f_l_o_a_t  in  any  FEA
     file  may be treated as a vector of spectral parameters; see
     _s_p_e_c__p_a_r_a_m__f_i_e_l_d and _s_p_e_c__r_e_p in the Parameters section.

     The spectral values are computed for the specified number of
     frequencies,  which must be at least 2.  The frequencies are
     equispaced from 0 to half the sampling frequency.  There  is
     an  option to compute the spectrum to a lower order than the
     number of coefficients present in the analysis records.

     One output record is written for each input  record  in  the
     specified  range.  If ``-'' is given for the input file, the
     standard input is read.  If ``-'' is given  for  the  output
     file,  the  standard  output is written to.  The output file
     can be plotted using the plotspec(1-ESPS) command.

          computed,  even when more coefficients are available in
          the analysis records.  The program converts  the  spec-
          tral  parameters  to  reflection coefficients, carrying
          the computation out to the actual order of the  parame-
          ter  set  contained  in  the record.  In FEA_ANA files,
          when ----GGGG has not been specified,  the  actual  order  is
          given  by  the  header  item  _o_r_d_e_r__v_c_d, for records in
          which the _f_r_a_m_e__t_y_p_e field is VOICED or TRANSITION, and
          by  _o_r_d_e_r__u_n_v_c_d  in  other records.  In other files, or
          when ----GGGG has been specified, the actual order is assumed
          to  be  the  length  of  the field (or subsequence of a
          field) named by the parameter  _s_p_e_c__p_a_r_a_m__f_i_e_l_d.  After
          converting  the  parameters,  the program truncates the
          sequence of reflection coefficients to length _m_a_x__o_r_d_e_r
          and  computes a maximum_entropy spectrum from the trun-
          cated sequence.

          This procedure is _n_o_t equivalent to  simply  truncating
          the  original parameter set, for example by specifing a
          shorter field with _s_p_e_c__p_a_r_a_m__f_i_e_l_d.  The  latter  pro-
          cedure  may  give  incorrect  results, depending on the
          spectral representation (see _s_p_e_c__r_e_p in the Parameters
          section).   For  example,  the  _m autoregressive filter
          coefficients of order _m are not in general the same  as
          the first _m autoregressive filter coefficients of order
          _n (where _n>_m).

          fies  the  range  of  records  to be processed.  Either
          _f_i_r_s_t or _l_a_s_t may be omitted; then the default value is
          used.   If  _l_a_s_t  = _f_i_r_s_t + _i_n_c_r, the second form (with
          the plus sign) specifies the same range as  the  first.
          If  the  specified  range  contains  records not in the

     The following parameters are read as required.

     _n_u_m__f_r_e_q_s - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          The number of frequencies for which spectral values are
          computed.   The value in the parameter file is not used
          if a value is specified with the command-line option  ----
          nnnn....  The  default  value and restrictions are as for the
          argument of the option.

     _m_a_x__o_r_d_e_r - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          An upper bound on  the  order  of  the  maximum-entropy
          spectra that will be computed.  The value in the param-
          eter file is not used if a value is specified with  the
          command-line option ----oooo.... See the discussion of ----oooo in the
          Options section for the detailed interpretation of this
          parameter.

     _s_t_a_r_t - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          The number of the first record to be processed,  count-
          ing the first in the input file as number 1.  The value
          in the parameter file is not used if a  starting  value
          is given with the ----rrrr option.  The default value is 1.

     _n_a_n - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          The number of records to be processed.   The  value  in
          the  parameter  file  is  not  used if the ----rrrr option is
          specified.  By convention, a value of 0 means that  all
          records from the starting record through the end of the
          file are processed.  This also the default behavior  in
          case  no  value is specified either on the command line
          or in the parameter file.

     _s_p_e_c__p_a_r_a_m__f_i_e_l_d - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The field containing  the  spectral  parameters.   This
          must  be  explicitly  specified  in  the parameter file
          unless the input file is a FEA_ANA file  and  the   ---- GGGG
          option  is  not specified.  The default in that case is
          "spec_param".  This parameter may  be  simply  a  field
          name, or it may be of the form

          able  to  _g_r_a_n_g_e__s_w_i_t_c_h(3 -ESPSu).  The bracketed range
          specification specifies the indices of a subsequence of
          the  elements of the named field that are to be used as
          the spectral parameters.

     _s_p_e_c__r_e_p - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          A name or abbreviation for the type of spectral parame-
          ters.  Acceptable values include "RC" (reflection coef-
          ficients), "LAR" (log area ratios), "AUTO"  (normalized
          autocorrelation  coefficients),  "AFC"  (autoregressive
          filter coefficients),  "CEP"  (cepstrum  coefficients),
          and  "LSF"  (line spectral frequencies).  See the docu-
          mentation for reps_rc(_3-_E_S_P_S_s_p).  This  parameter  must
          be  explicitly  specified  in the parameter file unless
          the input file is a FEA_ANA file and the ----GGGG  option  is
          not  specified.   The  default in that case is the con-
          tents of the generic header item _s_p_e_c__r_e_p.

     _p_o_w_e_r__f_i_e_l_d - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          A field containing the total  power  of  the  spectrum.
          Either  this  parameter  or  _p_o_w_e_r  must  be explicitly
          specified in the parameter file unless the  input  file
          is  a  FEA_ANA file and the ----GGGG option is not specified.
          The default in that case is "raw_power".

     _p_o_w_e_r - _f_l_o_a_t
          A numerical value for the total power of the  spectrum.
          This  value is used, and applies to all records, unless
          the parameter _p_o_w_e_r__f_i_e_l_d is defined and names a  field
          that  exists in the input file.  In that case, the con-
          tents of the named field are used instead.

     _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q__n_a_m_e - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The name of a generic header  item  that  contains  the
          sampling frequency.  Either this parameter or _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q
          must be explicitly  specified  in  the  parameter  file
          unless  the  input  file  is  a FEA_ANA file and the ----GGGG
          option is not specified.  The default in that  case  is
          "src_sf".

     _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q - _f_l_o_a_t
          A numerical value for  the  sampling  frequency.   This
          values  is  used unless the parameter _s_a_m_p__f_r_e_q__n_a_m_e is
          defined and names a generic header item that exists  in
          the  input file.  In that case, the value of the header
          item takes precedence.

     _c_o_n_t_i_n (CODED), _n_u_m__f_r_e_q_s (LONG).  For  input  FEA_ANA  (5 -

     added to the output file header.   In  addition,  the  input
     file is added as the source of the output file, and the com-
     mand line is added as a comment.

     The generic header item _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e is written in the  output
     file.    The   value  written  is  computed  by  taking  the
     _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e value from the header of the input file (or zero,
     if  such  a  header item doesn't exist) and adding to it the
     offset time (from the beginning of the input  file)  of  the
     first  point  or  record  processed.  If _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q doesn't
     exist in the input file, it defaults to 1.  Otherwise, it is
     copied  to  the  output  file  header.   This item gives the
     number of records per second of original data analyzed.

     me_spec: can't allocate memory--input spectral parameters
     me_spec: can't allocate memory--lpc filter
     me_spec: can't allocate memory--reflection coefficients
     me_spec: unknown spectral parameter type

     When _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l!=0, the  reflection  coefficients,  average
     raw power, location tag, and inverse filter coefficients are
     listed for each record.

     The _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n field in an input FEA_ANA record,  defined  as
     ``number of samples to synthesize from frame,'' is copied to
     the  _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n  field  in  a  spectral  record,  defined  as
     ``number  of  samples in analysis window.''  This is invalid
     if the FEA_ANA file was produced by a program for which  the
     two are different.

     In order to produce FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS) that can  be  overlaid
     on  FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS) files produced by _f_f_t (1-ESPS), the ----GGGG
     option should be used. This produces a generic FEA_SPEC (5 -
     ESPS) file without the voicing information.
