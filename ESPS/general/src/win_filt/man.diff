win_filt \- Designs a FIR filter using Kaiser Windowing
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
win_filt
.BI \-P " param_file"
[
.BI \-x " debug_level"
]
file.filter
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program \fIwin_filt\fR designs a linear-phase finite-impulse response
(FIR) filter with its specifications defined in the parameter file 
\fIparam_file\fR.  The filter coefficients are saved in the output file
\fIfile.filter\fR.  If \fIfile.filter\fR is replaced by "-", the 
standard output is written.
.PP
The design method is based on the Kaiser Window -- a \fIsinc\fR function
representing the ideal response is multiplied by a Kaiser window to obtain a
finite length filter.  Type I (symmetric and odd) and type II (symmetric
and even) multiband filter design are supported.
.PP
Also see the shell script \fIxfir_filt(1-ESPS)\fR that is a cover
script for this and other FIR filter design program.  
.PP
Use \fIfiltspec(1-ESPS)\fR to compute the actual filter response; use
\fIplotspec(1-ESPS)\fR to view the response.  For example, 
.PP
\fIfiltspec file.filter - | plotspec -\fR
.PP
The number of output filter taps is determined automatically by 
\fIwin_filt\fR in order to meet the design specification.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file \fR[params]\fP"
uses the parameter file 
.I param_file
rather than the default, which is \fIparams\fP. 
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If 
.I debug_level
is positive,
.I win_filt
prints debugging messages and other information on the standard error
output.  The messages proliferate as the  
.I debug_level
increases.  If \fIdebug_level\fP is 0 (the default), no messages are
printed.  
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The following parameters are read from the \fIparam_file\fR.
.TP
.I samp_freq - float
Specifies the sampling frequency of the filter.  This number is used
for scaling the values of \fIband_edge[i]\fR parameters.
.TP
.I nbands - int
Specifies the number of bands.  For example, for a bandpass filter, 
\fInbands\fR is \fI3\fR.
.TP
.I band_edge[i] - float
Specifies the \fIi\fRth cutoff frequency in Hz.  There are \fInbands+1\fR
\fIband_edge[i]\fR parameters.  The first \fIband_edge1\fR must
start with 0, and the last frequency must end with the Nyquist rate.
The cutoff frequency is in the center of the region specified by
\fItrans_band\fR.
For example, for a 8KHz bandpass filter with stopband of 0 to 800 Hz
and 2200 to 4000 Hz, and passband of 1200 to 1800 Hz, 
the parameter \fIBand_edge1\fR is 0, \fIband_edge2\fR is 1000,
\fIband_edge3\fR is 2000, \fIband_edge4\fR is 4000, and
\fItrans_band\fR is 400.  Typically, the filter is 6 dB down at the
band edge of transition.
.TP
.I band[i]_des - float
Specifies desired value for the \fIi\fRth band.  For example, for
a 3-band bandpass filter, \fIband1_des\fR is 0, \fIband2_des\fR is 1,
and \fIband3_des\fR is 0;
.TP
.I rej_db - float
Specifies both the rejection ratio in dB from one passband to
stopband, and the peak error in the passband.
.TP
.I trans_band - float
Specifies the transition bandwidth in Hz from one band to another.
.TP
.I evenflag - int
This is an optional parameter.  If not specified, by default \fIwin_filt\fR
designs a filter with odd filter length; otherwise, a value of 1 forces
even length, and a value of 0 forces odd length.
.PP
.SH ESPS COMMON
No ESPS common parameter processing is used.
.PP
.SH ESPS HEADERS
A new \fIFEA_FILT\fP(5\-ESPS) header is created for the  output  file.   The
program  fills  in  appropriate values in the common part of
the FEA_FILT header as well as the  following  generic  header  items.
.PP
The \fIsamp_freq\fR generic header item contains value of the \fIsamp_freq\fR
parameter.
.PP
The \fItrans_band\fR generic header item contains value of the \fItrans_band\fR
parameter.
.PP
The \fIrej_db\fR generic header item contains value of the \fIrej_db\fR
parameter.
.PP
In addition, the generic header item \fIdelay_samples\fR  (type  DOUBLE) is
added  to the header. \fIDelay_samples\fR  is  equal  to  
(filter length  -  1)/2.   
This represents  the  delay  to  the  center  of  the peak of the
impulse response.
