echo In order to test mcplay, you must have your converters properly
echo configured and wired to the clocks.

echo Wire your speech output to d/a channel 0
echo and connect clock zero from the EF-12 to the d/a clock input.

echo Check the default names for the clock and converter device.
echo The clock device might be /dev/dacp0/clk or /dev/dacp0/efclk \(for
echo an EF-12M\).   If the default isn\'t what you need then change the
echo entry in the install script and recompile play \(install play\).
