.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given an ESPS spectrum (FEA_SPEC) file
.I spec_subr
selects the spectrum data corresponding to frequencies in a specified band
and writes the result to an output FEA_SPEC file (see
.IR FEA_SPEC (5\-ESPS)).
The output file is in ``ARB_FIXED'' format,
meaning that the header contains an explicit list of the selected frequencies.
``Extraneous'' input fields (those not part of the FEA_SPEC specification)
are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-b " low" : "high" "\fR [(none)]"
.TP
.BI \-b " low" :+ "width"
This ``option'' is required; there are no default values.
The first form specifies the selected band of frequencies
by giving the upper and lower limits as a pair of real number.
The second for (with the plus sign)
specifies the band by its lower limit and width.
Thus, if
.IR high " = " low " + " width,
the two forms specify the same frequency band.
.TP
.BI \-r " start" : "last" "\fR [1:(last in file)]"
.TP
.BI \-r " start" :+ "incr"
.TP
.BI \-r " start"
In the first form, a pair of unsigned integers specifies the range
of records to be processed.
Either
.I start
or
.I last
may be omitted; then the default value is used.
If
.IR last " = " start " + " incr,
the second form (with the plus sign) specifies the same range as the first.
The third form (omitting the colon) specifies a single record.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If
.I debug_level
is positive,
.I testsd
prints debugging messages and other information on the standard error
output.  The messages proliferate as the
.I debug_level
increases.  If \fIdebug_level\fP is 0 (the default), no messages are
printed.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
No ESPS parameter file is accessed.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
The ESPS common file is not accessed.
.SH ESPS HEADERS
.PP
The program reads the header items
.I freq_format,
.I spec_type,
.I contin,
.I num_freqs,
and
.I frame_meth
in the header of the input file.
It also checks for the presence of the field
.I tot_power
in the input to decide whether to create the same field is the output.
.PP
The header of the output file is a newly created FEA_SPEC header
containing the required generic header items and field definitions (see
.IR FEA_SPEC (5\-ESPS)).
The value of
.I freq_format
in the output is ARB_FIXED, regardless of the value in the input
(which must not be ARB_VAR, however).
The values of
.I spec_type,
.I contin,
and
.I frame_meth
are copied from the input, and so is
.I frmlen
if
.I frame_meth
is FIXED.
The value of
.I num_freqs
is the number of frequencies represented in the output, and the header item
.I freqs
lists the frequencies.
.PP
If the input file is tagged, then so is the output.
In that case either
.I src_sf
or
.I sf
is copied from the input header\*-\c
.I src_sf
if present and
.I sf
otherwise.
The generic header item
.I start_time
is written with a value computed by taking the
.I start_time
from the input header (or zero, if the item doesn't exist) and adding to it
the relative time from the first record in the input file
to the first record processed.
The computation of
.I start_time
depends on the value of the generic header item
.I record_freq
in input.
If that item isn't present,
.I start_time
is just copied from the input to the output.
.PP
The items
.I start
and
.I nan
are written to contain the starting record number
and the number of records to be processed
(with 0 implying all records up to the end of the file).
As usual, the command line is added as a comment,
and the header of the input file is added as a source file to the output.
.PP
Items
.I band_low
and
.I band
in the output header record the lower limit and the bandwidth
of the band specified with
.BR \-b .
.SH FUTURE CHANGES
.PP
Parameter-file processing.
.SH EXAMPLES

.SH ERRORS AND DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
If an unknown option is specified, or if the number of file names is wrong,
.I spec_subr
prints a synopsis of command-line usage and exits.
The program exits with an error message if any of the following are true:
.B \-r
specifies an empty range or a starting record number of 0 or less,
.BR \-b
is lacking or specifies a bandwidth of 0 or less,
no frequencies of the input file lie in the given range,
or the input file has a
.I freq_format
of ARB_VAR.
A warning message is issued if a tagged input file contains neither
.I src_sf
nor
.I sf.
