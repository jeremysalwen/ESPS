.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIcnvlab\fP reads the time-marked labels in a NIST 
label file \fInist_file\fP, and writes an equivalent \fIwaves\fP+ 
label file \fIwaves_file\fP.  The input file contains one label 
per line with three fields: (1) the starting sample number; (2) 
the ending sample number; and (3) the label text (which may include 
blanks).  
.PP
.PP
The output file \fIwaves_file\fP contains one label per line (after 
an initial line with "#"), with three fields: (1) the time (in
seconds) of the label; (2) the color of the label (RGB); (3) the 
label text.  Note that labels do not have a start and end time.  By 
convention, the time of a waves+ label is the ending time.  
.PP
The sampling rate to be assumed by \fIcnvlab\fP when interpreting
sample numbers is given by the \fB-s\fP option.
.PP
In the default mode (no \fB-b\fP option), \fIcnvlab\fP produces one
\fIwaves\fP+ label per input label, with the time corresponding to the
ending sample number of the input label.  If the first input label
does not begin with sample 0, \fIcnvlab\fP issues a warning and
generates a special label (with text "UNL", for "unlabelled") to mark
the actual starting point of the first label.  If the ending time of
one label is not the same as the starting point of the next label (a
relatively rare case in the NIST databases), \fIcnvlab\fP issues a
warning.  If the ending time of one label exceeds the starting time of
the next label, \fIcnvlab\fP issues a warning and also inserts a
special label (again, with text "UNL") to mark the starting time of
the that next label.
.PP
If the \fB-b\fP option is used, \fIcnvlab\fP produces two \fIwaves\fP+
labels per input label \- one each for the starting point and the
ending point.  The text for the former is the input label text with
"_S" appended, and the text for the latter is the input label text
with "_E" appended.
.PP
In the default mode, the color of the \fIwaves\fP+ labels is set to
green, with the color of the special "UNL" labels set to blue.  If
\fB-m\fP is used, the \fIwaves\fP+ endpoint labels have color green,
and the starting point labels have the color blue.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-s " sampling_rate \fR[8000]\fP"
Sets the sampling rate used to compute the times associate with the 
sample numbers in \fInist_file\fP.   
.TP
.BI \-b 
Specifies that both the start and end points of the input label each
be turned into a \fIwaves\fP+ label.  This results in two output
labels for each input label.  See the DESCRIPTION about for details.
