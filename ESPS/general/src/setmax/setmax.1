.SH NAME
setmax - find maximum sampled data value and store in max_value FEA_SD header item
.sp
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setmax
[ 
.BI \-x " debug_level"
]
.I input output
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Setmax
takes a single-channel, real, FEA_SD file \fIinput\fP, finds the
maximum and miminum values in the file, and produces an output FE_SD
file that duplicates \fIinput\fP, but has the correct value stored in
the \fImax_value\fP generic in the file header.  The value stored in
\fImax_value\fP is the larger of the absolute values of the minimum
and maximum.  The principal use of \fIsetmax\fP is to pre-process
files to be played with a D/A conversion program that can scale the
data to use the maximum output range.  (Most ESPS processing programs
do not fill in the generic header item \fImax_value\fP, as headers
usually are written before the data are processed.)
.PP
If 
.I input
is "\-" then the input is read from the standard input.  This is
somewhat less efficient than is the case when \fIinput\fP is a disk
file because \fIsetmax\fP has to store the data from \fIinput\fP in a
temporary file.  If \fIoutput\fP is "\-" then the output is directed
to the standard output.
.sp
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level" "\fR [0]"
A positive value specifies that debugging output be printed on the
standard error output.  Larger values result in more output.  The
default is 0, for no output.
.br
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
A parameter file is not read by \fIsetmax\fP.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is not read by \fIsetmax\fP.
.SH ESPS HEADER
The file header for \fIoutput\fP is created from the input header by 
means of \fIcopy_header\fP.  Thus, for example, all of the generic 
header items are copied over.
