.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIGetparam\fR processes the ESPS parameter file \fIparam_file \fP and
ESPS Common.  It then obtains the value of the parameter
\fIparam_name\fP and prints its value in ASCII to standard output.
.PP
The main purpose of \fIgetparam\fP is to facilitate the writing of
ESPS shell scripts.  With \fIgetparam\fP, you can process a script
command line parameter file (\fB-P\fP) option in such a way to make
the script conform to the standard behavior of ESPS programs that
accept \fB-P\fP.  For example, if the parameter file passed to
\fIgetparam\fP specifies run-time prompts for parameter values ("?="
instead of "=" in the parameter file), \fIgetparam\fP will prompt for
the values.  This has no particular value when running \fIgetparam\fP
interactively, but it does the right thing when called from within a
script (i.e., the caller of the script is prompted).
.PP
\fIGetparam\fP is also useful if you want to find out the parameter
values that will be used by any ESPS program that is passed a given
parameter file, including the effects of ESPS Common (recall that 
the purpose of ESPS Common is to allow programs to set parameter
values for use by programs that are run subsequently).  
.PP
Parameter processing by \fIgetparam\fP follows standard ESPS
conventions: Unless the parameter value is overridden by the value in
ESPS Common, the value printed by \fIgetparam\fP is the value from the
parameter file \fIparam_file\fP.  This value will be overridden by the
value in Common (if the Common file exists and contains a value for
\fIparam_name\fP) provided that ESPS Common processing is enabled and
that the Common file is younger than the parameter file.  If a
\fIcheckfile\fP is specfied, the parameter file value for
\fIparam_name\fP will be overridden by the value in Common only if
\fIcheckfile\fP is identical to the \fIfilename\fP entry in the Common
file.
.PP
ESPS Common processing is enabled unless the unix environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON is "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom in
the user's home directory.  This may be overridden by setting the
environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback from
parameter and Common file processing (by the library \fIread_params\fP
and \fIgetsym\fP functions) is determined by the environment variable
ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing
increasingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a
default value of 3 is assumed.
.PP
The \fB-p\fP "option" giving the parameter name must be given.  Other
command line options trully are optional.  It is an error to give both
\fB-n\fP and \fB-c\fP.  If \fIparam_name\fP corresponds to an integer
or float array, a warning is issued if there is an inconsistency
between the \fIsym_size\fP(3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) returned
value and
\fIgetsym_ia\fP(3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) or \fIgetsym_fa\fP(3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)
(this should never happen).
.PP
\fIGetparam\fP returns values to the calling shell as follows:
If a parameter was obtained successfully, the value returned is 0.  
If a user-interface error occurred, the value returned is 1. 
If the parameter exists but is an array size inconsistency was found, 
the value returned is 2.  If the parameter does not exist or if 
\fIread_params\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) returns with an 
error status, the value returned is 3. 
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-p " param_name"
Specifies the name of the parameter whose value is desired.
\fIGetparam\fP exits with an error message if this option is not given.  
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file" " \fR[params]\fP"
Specifies the name of the ESPS parameter file to process.  If you want
to force the parameter to come only from ESPS common, use "\fB-P\fP
/dev/null".  
.TP
.BI \-n 
Do not process ESPS Common (i.e., always get the parameter value from
the file specified by the \fB-P\fP option).  (Within \fIgetparam\fP, the
effect of the \fB-n\fP is to have \fIread_params\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)
called with the SC_NOCOMMON flag.)  Note also that Common processing 
can be disabled by setting the unix environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  
.TP
.BI \-c " checkfile"
If the ESPS Common file exists, this option specifies that the Common
file should be processed only if the \fIcheckfile\fP matches the value
of the \fIfilename\fP in the Common file.  This option cannot be given
if the \fB-n\fP is given.  This option will have no effect if the unix
environment variable USE_ESPS_COMMON is "off".  
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If \fIdebug_level\fP is positive,
.I getparam
outputs debugging messages. The messages proliferate as 
.I debug_level 
increases.  For level 0, there is no output.
.TP
.BI \-z
Specifies "silent" mode.  In this mode, warnings are not printed
(parameter not found, parameter array size inconsistency).  This mode
is most useful inside of shell scripts.  For complete silence, note
that the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE should be set to 0;
otherwise, various feedback messages will be issued by
\fIread_params\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) and \fIgetsym\fP
(3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The ESPS parameter file specified by the \fB-P\fP option is 
processed only to obtain the value of the parameter named by the 
\fB-p\fP option.  In this respect, \fIgetparam\fP is quite different 
from other ESPS programs, which use the parameter file to pass 
parameter values that control the operation of the program. 
.SH ESPS HEADERS
.PP
No ESPS files are processed by \fIgetparam\fP.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is read provided that Common processing is enabled (no
\fB-n\fP option and environment variable USE_ESPS_COMMON not set to
"off") and that the Common file is younger than the ESPS parameter
file.  In this case, parameters present in Common override values from
the parameter file.  If the \fB-c\fP is given, the Common values
override the parameter file values only if the \fIcheckfile\fP matches
the value of the \fIfilename\fP in the Common file.
