     _N_o_d_i_f_f is a shell script which finds the  nth-order  differ-
     ence  of  field  _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e  in  the  ESPS FEA (5-ESPS) file
     _f_e_a__i_n and writes the result to  the  output  file  _f_e_a._o_u_t.
     The  name  of  the  field  in the output file is obtained by
     appending one of __d_1, ..., __d_5 to _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e,  in  agreement
     with _o_r_d_e_r.

     The first order difference of _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e is computed element
     -  by-element as _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e[_i][_r_e_c_n_o] - _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e[_i][_r_e_c_n_o-
     _1] for all elements iiii of the field  _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e.  The  second
     order   difference   is  found  as  _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e[_i][_r_e_c_n_o]  -_2
     _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e[_i][_r_e_c_n_o-_1] + _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e[_i][_r_e_c_n_o-_2].

     _N_o_d_i_f_f uses _t_o_f_e_a_s_d (1- ESPS)  to  translate  the  specified
     field  in  the  input file into a FEA_SD (5-ESPS) file.  The
     output of _t_o_f_e_a_s_d is piped to _f_i_l_t_e_r (1- ESPS),  which  uses
     predefined FEA_FILT (5-ESPS) files to find the correct order
     difference.  _f_e_a_f_u_n_c (1-ESPS) is used to give  the  filtered
     data  the  correct field name, and _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a (1-ESPS) is used
     to combine the differenced data with the  original  data  to
     form the output records.

     The following options are supported:

     ----oooo _o_r_d_e_r [1]
          determines which order  difference  to  compute;  valid
          values  are 1 through 5.  The FEAFILT files _d_i_f_f_1._f_i_l_t,
          ..., _d_i_f_f_5._f_i_l_t contain the  necessary  filter  coeffi-
          cients.    They    are    found    in   the   directory
          $ESPS_BASE/lib/filters.

     ----ffff _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e [spec_param]
          name of the field whose difference is to be found.

     ----rrrr _r_a_n_g_e [1:last_in_file]
          range of records to process.   Default  is  to  process
          every  record  in the input file.  The ----rrrr option cannot
          be used with standard input.

     ----xxxx _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l [0]
          If _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l  is  positive,  debugging  messages  and
          other  information  are  printed  on the standard error
          output.  The messages proliferate  as  the  _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l
