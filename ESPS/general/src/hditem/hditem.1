.SH NAME
hditem - print an item from an ESPS file header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hditem
[
.B \-s
]
.BI \-i " item_name"
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Hditem
prints an item from an ESPS file header on the standard output.
If the
.B \-s
(silent) option is given, it merely returns a success or failure
status, depending on whether or not the given generic item is defined
in the file header.
.PP
\fIHditem\fR looks for items by the name given in 
ESPS(5\-ESPS) (the common or universal part of the header)
and generic header items.
Sometimes these names are the same as the names printed
by psps(1\-ESPS), but this is a coincidence. Support for the
psps(1\-ESPS) item names is not provided.
.PP
If \- is specified as the input file, standard input is read.
.PP
The following "items" are universal or common header items
and are always recognized:
.IP \fIprogram\fR
The program that created the file
.IP \fIversion\fR
The version of the program that created the file.
.IP \fIprogdate\fR
The date the program that created the file was compiled.
.IP \fIdate\fR
The file creation date
.IP \fItyptxt\fR
The typtxt field in the file header
.IP \fIcomment\fR
The comment text in the file header
.IP \fIcurrent_path\fR
The path (including host name) to the directory where the file was created
.IP \fIndrec\fR
The number of data records in the file
.IP \fItype\fR
The ESPS type code.
.IP \fIhdvers\fR
The version number of header.h used to make the input file.
.IP \fIuser\fR
The first 8 characters of the username (login name) of the
creater of the file.
.PP
Two pseudo items are also always recognized:
.IP \fIhostname\fR
The host system on which the file was created
.IP \fIcwd\fR
The directory path to where the file was created on the host system.
.LP
These two items make up the \fIcurrent_path\fR item described above.
They have been broken out to make shell script processing easier.
.PP
Other items are searched for using the \fIget_genhd\fP(3-ESPS) call.
.SH OPTIONS
