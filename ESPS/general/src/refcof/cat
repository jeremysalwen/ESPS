     _r_e_f_c_o_f takes an ESPS sampled data file,  _f_i_l_e._s_d,  and  pro-
     duces  an  ESPS FEA_ANA analysis file _f_i_l_e._r_c containing the
     reflection coefficients corresponding to one or more  fixed-
     length sampled-data frames.

     All input frames have the same length  _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n  (see   ---- llll
     option).  The initial point of the first frame is determined
     by the ----pppp option or by _s_t_a_r_t in the parameter file.  Initial
     points  of  any  subsequent frames follow at equal intervals
     _s_t_e_p (see ----SSSS option).  Thus the 3 cases  _s_t_e_p  <  _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n,
     _s_t_e_p  = _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n, and _s_t_e_p > _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n, correspond to over-
     lapping frames, exactly abutted frames, and frames separated
     by gaps.

     The number of frames is the minimum sufficient  to  cover  a
     specified range of _n_a_n points (see ----pppp and ----ZZZZ options), given
     _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n and _s_t_e_p.  The last frame in each file may overrun
     the  range,  in which case a warning is printed.  If a frame
     overruns the end of a file, it is normally filled  out  with
     zeros (but see ----ZZZZ).

     The reflection coefficients, along with the computed  values
     for  _r_a_w__p_o_w_e_r  and  _l_p_c__p_o_w_e_r,  are  then stored in FEA_ANA
     records.  No pitch pulse information is written to the file.

     If _f_i_l_e._s_d is "-" then the input is read from  the  standard
     input  and  if _f_i_l_e._r_c is "-" then the output is directed to
     the standard output.

     By default, the program  uses  the  autocorrelation  method,
     which  applies  the  standard  method of computing the auto-
     correlation function and the Levinson algorithm for  comput-
     ing  the  reflection  coefficients  from the autocorrelation
     values.  Note that the standard autocorrelation  method  may
     yield poor results when using a small number (i.e. < 100) of
     data samples.  The other methods can be specified  by  using
     the  ---- mmmm option.  The most accurate usually is STRCOV, espe-
     cially for small frame lengths.

     The methods AUTOC, STRCOV, and STRCOV1 operate by estimating
     the   autocorrelation  function  and  then  transforming  to
     reflection coefficients.  In these cases,  the  program  can
     also  optionally  multiply the autocorrelation function by a
     sinc function (----ssss option) prior to computing the  reflection
     coefficients.  This  has the effect of reducing the spectral
     resolution if the spectrum of these coefficients is plotted.

     Of the two structured  covariance  methods  [2],  STRCOV  is
     consderably  faster  and  better  behaved  than STRCOV1.  We
     include STRCOV1 as  it  may  be  useful  in  certain  cases.
     STRCOV  uses a fast, single channel algorithm _s_t_r_u_c_t__c_o_v (3-
     ESPS) developed by  John  Burg  and  programmed  by  Bernard
     Fraenkel.   STRCOV2  uses  an older (but more general) algo-
     rithm _g_e_n_b_u_r_g (3-ESPS) that was programmed by Daniel Wenger.
     Note that the ----cccc and ----iiii options are relevant for controlling
     the convergence of STRCOV.   The  VBURG  method  is  a  fast
     approximation  to  structured  covariance that was developed
     and programmed by John Burg and Shankar Narayan [3].

     If spectral representations other  than  reflection  coeffi-
     cients  are  desired, use _t_r_a_n_s_p_e_c (1-ESPS) or _s_p_e_c_t_r_a_n_s (1-
     ESPS) on the output of _r_e_f_c_o_f. If you want the actual  spec-
     trum, use _m_e__s_p_e_c (1-ESPS) on the output of _r_e_f_c_o_f.

     _x_r_e_f_c_o_f is a script that runs _r_e_f_c_o_f on a  single  frame  of
     data  that is specified by the range option (----rrrr or ----pppp) or by
     means of ESPS Common.  A pop-up window is used to prompt the
     user   for   _w_i_n_d_o_w__t_y_p_e,   _m_e_t_h_o_d,  _o_r_d_e_r,  _c_o_n_v__t_e_s_t,  and
     _m_a_x__i_t_e_r.  The results of the _a_n_a_l_y_s_i_s are displayed in  two
     pop-up  windows - one containing the reflection coefficents,
     and one containing a maximum-entropy power spectrum computed
     from  these reflection coeffiecients.  _x_r_e_f_c_o_f makes used of
     _e_x_p_r_o_m_p_t (1-ESPS), _m_e__s_p_e_c (1-ESPS), _p_l_o_t_s_p_e_c (1-ESPS),  and
     _x_t_e_x_t (1-ESPS).

     The parameter prompting for _x_r_e_f_c_o_f is performed by means of
     the   parameter  file  named  PWrefcof,  which  is  normally
     obtained from $ESPS_BASE/lib/params.  However, if you have a
     file by this name in the current directory (or if you define
     the environment variable ESPS_PARAMS_PATH  and  put  one  on
     that path), it will be used instead.

     The following options are supported (only ----rrrr or  ----pppp  can  be
     given for _x_r_e_f_c_o_f):

     ----PPPP _p_a_r_a_m
          uses the parameter file _p_a_r_a_m rather than the  default,
          which is _p_a_r_a_m_s.

          In the first two forms, a  pair  of  unsigned  integers
          specifies  the  range  of  sampled data to analyze.  If
          _l_a_s_t = _f_i_r_s_t + _i_n_c_r, the  third  form  (with  the  plus
          sign)  specifies the same range as the first two forms.
          If _f_i_r_s_t is omitted, the default value of  1  is  used.
          If _l_a_s_t is omitted, then a default frame length of 1000
          results.  If the specified range contains points not in
          the file, the last frame is truncated to fit the actual
          data.  Both forms of the option override the values  of
          _s_t_a_r_t  and  _n_a_n  in  the  parameter file or ESPS Common
          file.  If the ----pppp option  is  not  used,  the  range  is
          determined  from  the  ESPS Parameter or Common file if
          the appropriate parameters are present.  Note that  the
          default frame length of 1000 also results if _n_a_n is not
          in the parameter or Common file and if no ----pppp is used.

     ----rrrr _r_a_n_g_e
          ----rrrr is a synonym for ----pppp.

     ----llll _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n [0]
          Specifies the length of each frame.  If the  option  is
          omitted, the parameter file is consulted.  A value of 0
          (from either the option or the  parameter  file)  indi-
          cates  that  a  single  frame of length _n_a_n (see ----pppp) is
          processed; this is  also  the  default  value  in  case
          _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n is not specified either with the ----llll option or
          in the parameter file.

          there,  a default equal to _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n is used (resulting
          in exactly abutted frames).  (The same default  applies
          if _s_t_e_p is given a value of 0).

     ----wwww _w_i_n_d_o_w__t_y_p_e[RECT]
          The name of the data window to apply  to  the  data  in
          each  frame  before  computing reflection coefficients.
          If the option is omitted, the parameter  file  is  con-
          sulted,  and  if  no  value is found there, the default
          used is a rectangular window with amplitude one.   Pos-
          sible  window  types include rectangular ("RECT"), Ham-
          ming ("HAMMING"), Hanning ("HANNING"),  cosine  (COS4),
          and  triangular  ("TRIANG");  see  the window(3-ESPSsp)
          manual page.  If the last frame is truncated, the  win-
          dow  is applied to the truncated data (e.g., a triangu-
          lar window is zero at the start and end  of  the  trun-
          cated data).

     ----mmmm _m_e_t_h_o_d[autoc]
          Specifies the spectrum analysis method.  The default is
          the  autocorrelation  method.   Also  available are the
          covariance method ("cov"), Burg method ("burg"),  modi-
          fied  Burg  method ("mburg"), fast modified Burg method
          ("fburg"),   stuctured   covariance    ("strcov"    and
          "strcov1"),  and  vector Burg ("vburg", fast approxima-
          tion to structured covariance.  Of the  two  structured
          covariance methods, the first ("strcov" is considerably
          faster and  better  behaved;  "strcov1"  is  older  but
          included  as  it  may  prove  useful  on  occasion.  If
          "strcov"  is  used,  the  ----cccc  and  ----iiii  options   become
          relevant.   The  ----mmmm option overrides the value that may
          be in the parameter file.  The default applies only  if
          there is no value in the parameter file.

     ----eeee _p_r_e_e_m_p_h_a_s_i_s[0.0]

          signal.

     ----cccc _c_o_n_v__t_e_s_t[1e-5]
          Specifies, for the STRCOV method  only  (not  including
          STRCOV1),  a  convergence  test  value.   The lower the
          value, the smaller the change required on  each  itera-
          tion  before  the  estimator  terminates,  and the more
          iterations that normally will result.

     ----iiii _m_a_x__i_t_e_r[20]
          Specifies, for the STRCOV method  only  (not  including
          STRCOV1),  the  maximum  number  of iterations that the
          estimator will run through before terminating.  A warn-
          ing  will  indicate if the estimator terminates because
          max_iter has been exceeded.

     ----oooo _o_r_d_e_r[15]
          Specifies  the  order  (number  of  reflection  coeffi-
          cients),  and  overrides  the  value that may be in the
          parameter file.  The default applies only if  there  is
          no value in the parameter file.

     ----ssss _s_i_n_c__n
          For the AUTOC, STRCOV, and STRCOV1 methods,  the  auto-
          correlation  the autocorrelation function is multiplied
          by the function _s_i_n (_x / _s_i_n_c__n) before  computing  the
          reflection  coefficients.  In the frequency domain this
          has the effect of convolving the spectrum with a boxcar
          function  of  width _f / _s_i_n_c__n, where _f is the sampling
          frequency.  The value of _s_i_n_c__n is recorded in  a  gen-
          eric header item.

     ----dddd    Specifies that the  dc  component  of  each  frame  is
          removed  before the analysis is performed.  DC revmoval
          takes place before windowing.

     ----ZZZZ    If the last frame normally would  overrun  the  stated
          range,  _r_e_f_c_o_f reads past the range to fill up the last
          frame; if the the last would go past the file end,  the
          frame  is  filled  with  zoes. Use of ----ZZZZ, inhibits this
          behavior by processing one less frame.  The  result  is
          that  the  end  of  the  last  frame falls short of the
          stated range.  A common use of ----ZZZZ is to  avoid  getting
          unwanted zeros in training sequences.

     ----zzzz    Specifies that /fIrefcof/fP operate silently,  without
          issuing various warnings.

     ----xxxx _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l [0]
          A positive value specifies  that  debugging  output  be
          printed  on  the  standard error output.  Larger values
          result in more output.  The default is 0, for  no  out-
          put.

     The parameter file is not required to be present,  as  there
     are  default  parameter values that apply.  If the parameter
     file does exist, the following parameters are read:

     _s_t_a_r_t - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The first point in the input sampled data file that  is
          processed.   A  value  of 1 denotes the first sample in
          the file.  This is only read if the ----pppp  option  is  not
          used.   If it is not in the parameter (or Common) file,

          0, the whole file is processed. _N_a_n is read only if the
          ----pppp option is not used.  (See the discussion under ----llll).

     _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The number of points in each frame.  This parameter  is
          not  read  if the ----llll option is specified.  A value of 0
          indicates that a single frame of  length  _n_a_n  is  pro-
          cessed;   this  is  also  the  default  value  in  case
          _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n is specified neither with the ----llll  option  nor
          in the parameter file.

     _s_t_e_p - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          Initial points of consecutive  frames  differ  by  this
          number of samples.  This parameter is not read if the ----
          SSSS option is specified.  If the option is omitted and no
          value  is  found in the parameter file, a default equal
          to _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n is  used  (resulting  in  exactly  abutted
          frames).

     _w_i_n_d_o_w__t_y_p_e - _s_t_r_i_n_g
          The data window to apply to the data.   This  parameter
          is not read if the command-line option ----wwww is specified.
          If the option is omitted and if no value  is  found  in
          the  parameter  file, the default used is "RECT", for a
          rectangular window with amplitude one.   Other  accept-
          able  values  include "HAMMING", for Hamming, and "TRI-
          ANG", for triangular; see the  window(3-ESPSsp)  manual
          page for the complete list.

     _o_r_d_e_r - _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

          The number of reflection coefficients computed for each
          frame of input data.  If no value is given in the file,
          a default value of 15 is used.  This value is not  read
          if the command line option ----oooo is used.

     _m_e_t_h_o_d - _s_t_r_i_n_g

          The spectrum analysis method  to  use.   The  available
          methods   are   autocorrelation   ("auto"),  covariance
          ("covar"), Burg ("burg"), modified Burg ("mburg"), fast
          modified  Burg  method  ("fburg"), stuctured covariance
          ("strcov" and "strcov1"), and vector Burg  ("vburg",  a
          fast  approximation  to  structured  covariance.  If no
          value is given in the file, the autocorrelation  method
          is  used  by  default.  The _m_e_t_h_o_d is not read from the
          parameter file if the command line option ----mmmm is used.

     _p_r_e_e_m_p_h_a_s_i_s - _f_l_o_a_t

          The preemphasis factor to be applied to input signal.

     _s_t_r_c_o_v__t_e_s_t - _f_l_o_a_t

          If STRCOV is used, this is the convergence  test  value
          (the lower the value, the smaller the change per itera-
          tion before termination). This is not  read  if  ----cccc  is
          used.

     _s_t_r_c_o_v__m_a_x_i_t_e_r - _i_n_t

          If STRCOV is used, this is the maximum number of itera-
          tions allowed before the estimator terminates.  This is
          not read if ----iiii is used.

     The values of parameters obtained from  the  parameter  file
     are printed if the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE is 3 or
     greater.  The default value is 3.

     ESPS Common is  read  provided  that  Common  processing  is
     enabled  and  that  the  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  entry  in  Common matches
     _f_i_l_e._s_d, in which case parameters present in Common override
     values from the parameter file, which in turn may be overri-
     den by command line options  (see  the  discussion  in  ESPS
     PARAMETERS  and  under  each option).   Common processing is
     useful when _r_a_n_g_e (1-ESPS) is used to select a segment  from
     _f_i_l_e._s_d. Common is not read if _f_i_l_e._s_d is standard input. If
     _f_i_l_e._r_c is not standard output and _f_i_l_e._s_d is  not  standard
     input,  the  Common parameters _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e (= file.sd), _p_r_o_g (=
     refcof), _s_t_a_r_t, and _n_a_n are written to ESPS Common.

     ESPS Common  processing  may  be  disabled  by  setting  the
     environment  variable USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default
     ESPS Common file is .espscom in the user's  home  directory.
     This  may  be  overidden by setting the environment variable
     ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of  Common  pro-
     cessing   is   determined   by   the   environment  variable
     ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no feedback and increasing lev-
     els causing increasingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE
     is not defined, a default value of 3 is assumed.

     A new file header is created for the FEA_ANA file.  The sam-
     pled  data header from the input header is added as a source
     in the output file header, and the command line is added  as
     a  comment.   The input file _f_i_l_e._s_d is set as the reference
     header for tags.

     The program writes the usual values into the common part  of
     the  output  header. _R_e_f_c_o_f writes the following values into
     the specified generic header items  in  the  output  FEA_ANA

     _o_r_d_e_r__v_c_d = 0

     _s_t_a_r_t = start
     _n_a_n = nan;
     _f_r_m_l_e_n = frame_len;
     _s_r_c__s_f = sample frequency of file.sd

     In addition, the following generic header items are  created
     and  filled with values used by _r_e_f_c_o_f: _m_e_t_h_o_d, _w_i_n_d_o_w__t_y_p_e,
     _D_C__r_e_m_o_v_e_d, _s_t_e_p.  All of these are CODED types, except  for
     _s_t_e_p,  which  is  LONG.  If a non-zero preemphasis factor is
     used, then the header item _p_r_e_e_m_p_h_a_s_i_s of FLOAT type is also
     written.

     The generic header item _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e (type DOUBLE) is  written
     in the output file.  The value written is computed by taking
     the _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e value from the header of the input  file  (or
     zero,  if such a header item doesn't exist) and adding to it
     the offset time (from the beginning of the  input  file)  of
     the  first point processed plus one half of _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n (thus,
     _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e is middle of the first frame, which is  appropri-
     ate  since  the  output  data  represent  the  entire frame;
     without this adjustment for _f_r_a_m_e__l_e_n, _w_a_v_e_s+ displays would
     not line up properly.

     The generic header item _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q (type DOUBLE) is written
     in  the  output  file.   The  value  is the number of output
     records per second of input data.

     The program will not yet compute reflection coefficients  of
     complex  signals;  if  presented with complex input data, it
     will silently discard the imaginary part and compute reflec-
     tion coefficients of the real part of the input.
