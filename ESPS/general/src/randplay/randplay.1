.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I Randplay 
accepts an ASCII file containing ESPS FEA_SD file names and produces
on standard output a script that can be used for randomized listening
comparisons.  The input file
.I compfile
lists groups of FEA_SD files that are to be compared within the group.  
Groups are separated by a line containing the single character "#".  
Within each group, FEA_SD file names are separated by white space or white
space followed by a newline.  Thus files can be listed one per-line 
or several per-line.  It is not necessary for the "#" marker to follow 
the final group.
.PP
For each group of FEA_SD files,
.I randplay
determines all possible two-file comparisons.  For each two-file 
comparison, 
.I randplay 
outputs a command that plays the two files in random order using the
specified FEA_SD play program (see 
.B \-n
).  The entire set of output commands for all groups (each causing two
files to be played) is itself output in random order.  
.PP
If 
.I compfile
is "\-", standard input is read.  All characters after 
.I compfile
in the command line are assumed to be option flags for the play 
program and are passed on to the play program each time it is 
called in the output script.  
.PP
.I Randplay
does not check to see if the FEA_SD files exist.  
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The ESPS parameter file is not read by 
.I randplay.
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
.PP
The ESPS common file is not written by 
.I randplay.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:  
.TP
.B\-a
Specifies that all "A-B" comparisons are to be made, including
comparisons of each file to itself.  Otherwise, files are compared to
other files in the same line from 
.I compfile
but not to themselves.  
.TP
.BI \-d " path"
Specifies a directory path that will be prepended to all of the 
file names in the output script.  A "/" is added to the 
.I path
by 
.I randplay.  
If the 
.B \-d
option is not used, file names will appear exactly as they do in 
the input file 
.I compfile.
.TP
.BI \-n " program \fR[play]\fP"
Determines the name of the play program that is used in the 
output shell script.  
.TP
.BI \-s
Specifies that a scoring sheet be output in the file 
.I scoresheet
in the current directory.  The scoring sheet is the sheet filled out by
listeners.

     play jpb.sd sn.sd
     play jtb.sd sn.sd
     play jpb.sd jtb.s

.fi
.PP
To play two files without knowing their order, one could do the 
following:
.nf

     %echo "file1.sd file2.sd" | randplay - | sh
