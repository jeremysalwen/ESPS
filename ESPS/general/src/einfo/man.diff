.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Program einfo(1) (or winfo(1)) is a tool for reading Entropic technical bulletins and release notes.  We wrote this program to make it easier to disseminate new information to the users, and to save tons of paper in shipments.
.PP
If the X11 window system is running then einfo(1) will pop up a control panel
with the names of the documents that you can read listed as buttons of the panel.  Just click on the document to read it.
.PP
If the X11 window system is NOT running then einfo(1) will list every document
it knows about.  Type "einfo documentnumber" to view the desired document.
