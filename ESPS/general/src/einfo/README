Releasing the mouse over a selected item causes the (view or print)
action selected in the middle panel to be invoked on the named
document.

NOTE:  if printing doesn't work...

The "Print File" button uses elpr(1) to print.  If you print and nothing
comes out check out the elpr(1) man page and setup environment variable
ELPR as your system needs it.

------

einfo is a simple example of the X Interface Generation (XIG) capabilities
of ESPS and xwaves+.  If you look in $ESPS_BASE/bin/einfo, you'll see 
that the meat of it is essentially the shell command

 fbuttons -F einfofil.BM -S einfocom.BM -M einfo.BM &

where the options specify a simple ASCII file for each of three panels. 
You can find the files in $ESPS_BASE/lib/menus.
