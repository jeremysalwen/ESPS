.SH DESCRIPTION
This program applies a time-varying linear FIR filter to a signal.
The FIR filter typically has coefficients equal to autoregressive
parameters of the signal computed using standard LPC analysis.
.PP
\fIIn_signal\fR is a 16-bit PCM \fIFEA_SD\fP(5-ESPS) 
file of \fISHORT\fR data type. 
\fIOut_signal\fR is the output FEA_SD filtered signal in \fISHORT\fR data type.
\fIIn_coef\fR may be a \fIFEA_ANA\fP(5-ESPS) file containing spectral parameters in the form
of reflection coefficients (if the generic header item \fIspec_rep\fR is
\fIRC\fR) or linear prediction coefficients (if \fIspec_rep\fR is AFC), as
produced by \fIrefcof\fP(1-ESPS) or \fItranspec\fP(1-ESPS)\fR.
Or \fIIn_coef\fR may be a \fIFEA\fP(5-ESPS) file containing the field \fIfm\fR for
formant frequencies and the field \fIbw\fR for formant bandwidths, as produced
by \fIformant(1-ESPS)\fR.
\fIGet_resid\fR converts the spectral information in \fIin_coef\fR to
predictor coefficients for inverse filtering.
.PP
If \fIin_signal\fR is an unpreemphasized speech signal, and
\fIin_coef\fR is its spectral representation, the resulting
\fIout_signal\fR is an approximation of the second derivative of the
glottal flow.  The derivative of the glottal volume velocity is
obtained via the \fB-i\fR option with \fIint_const\fR close to 1.0.
.PP
If \fIin_signal\fP or \fIin_coef\fP is "-", standard input is read.
But the input files cannot both be standard input.
.PP
If \fIout_signal\fR is "-", then standard output is written.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param_file \fR[params]\fP"
uses the parameter file \fIparam_file\fR rather than the default, 
which is \fIparams\fR. 
.TP
.BI \-r " first:last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first:+incr"
Determines the range of points from input file, \fIin_signal\fR.  In
the first form, a pair of unsigned integers gives the first and last
points of the range.  If \fIfirst\fR is omitted, 1 is used.  If
\fIlast\fR is omitted, the last point in the file is used.  The second
form is equivalent to the first with \fIlast = first + incr\fR.  If no
range is specified, the entire file is processed.
.TP
.BI \-p " "
Same as the \fB-r\fR option.
.TP
.BI \-s " first:last"
.TP
.BI \-s " first:+incr"
Same function as the \fB-r\fR option, but specifies the range of input data 
\fIin_signal\fR in seconds
.TP
.BI \-a " normal \fR[0]\fP"
A value of 1 indicates the output signal should be normalized to keep
DC gain equal to 1. This is a good choice when the residual is to be
used for epoch detection.  A value of 2 results in normalization by
the filter gain.  This would be appropriate if the residual is to
eventually excite a synthesizer (e.g. \fIlp_syn\fR).  A value of 0
causes no normalization, which might be appropriate for other types of
synthesizers.
.TP
.BI \-i " int_const \fR[0]\fP"
This is an integration constant between 0 and 1.0 that specifies the
coefficient of a first-order integrator to be applied to the inversed
signal to get an approximation of glottal flow derivative.  If the
speech was preemphasized during the LPC analysis used to obtain the
LPC coefficients, the correct value of \fIint_const\fR would usually
be 0.0.
.TP
.BI \-n " nformants"
If the input \fIin_coef\fR contains formant frequencies, this
parameter specifies that only the first \fInformants\fR formants
should used to inverse filter the speech.  The default is to use all
formants in the file.
.TP
.BI \-b " bandwidth"
If the input \fIin_coef\fR contains formants and their bandwidths, this
parameter specifies the formant bandwiths that should be used, rather than
the default bandwidths stored in the file.  If BW is the argument to the -b
option, then  \fIB[i] = int(BW) + F[i] * (BW - int(BW))\fR where
\fIF[i]\fR are the formant frequencies, \fIint(BW)\fR is the integer
part of the parameter \fIBW\fR, and \fIB[i]\fR are the synthetic 
bandwidths.
.TP
.BI \-y
If \fI-y\fR is specified the
coefficients and gains will switch abruptly at frame boundaries.
Otherwise, the LP coefficients and gain will be linearly
interpolated between frame centers.  
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If 
.I debug_level
is positive,
.I get_resid
prints debugging messages and other information on the standard error
output.  The messages proliferate as the  
.I debug_level
increases.  If \fIdebug_level\fP is 0 (the default), no messages are
printed.  
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The following parameters options are supported.
.TP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The first point in the input sampled data file that is processed.  A
value of 1 denotes the first sample in the file.  This is only read
if the \fB\-p\fP option is not used.  If it is not in the parameter
file, the default value of 1 is used.  
.TP
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The total number of data points to process.  If 
.I nan
is 0, the whole file is processed.  
.I Nan
is read only if the \fB\-p\fP option is not used.  (See the 
discussion under \fB\-l\fP).
.TP
.I "int_const - float"
.IP
See \fBOPTIONS\fR.
.TP
.I "normal - int"
.IP
See \fBOPTIONS\fR.
.TP
.I "band_width - float"
.IP
See \fBOPTIONS\fR.  A value 0 means default.
.TP
.I "nformants - int"
.IP
See \fBOPTIONS\fR.  A value 0 means default.
.TP
.I "interp - int"
.IP
See the \fB-y\fR option in \fBOPTIONS\fR.  A value 1 is to interpolate;
0 for otherwise.
.PP
.SH ESPS COMMON
No common parameter processing is supported
.PP
.SH ESPS HEADERS
The standard generic header items, \fIstart_time\fR for the starting time in 
seconds and \fIrecord_freq\fR for sampling frequency, and all non-default 
parameters used for processing are written to the header.
