.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Stats
considers an ESPS file to be a series of vectors, without interpretation.
For sampled data files, the vector has only one element.
For each element of the vector,
it computes the mean, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value,
and normalized sum of squares (power, in the case of sampled data).
It also determines the record number containing
the maximum and minimum values for each element. 
.PP
Multiple input files can be specified.
If \fIfile\fR is 
replaced by "\-", standard input is read. Here is a sample report:

.TE
.sp
.PP
By default, all records in the file, and every element in each record,
are processed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-x
A value greater than zero turns on debugging output from \fBstats\f and
any \fBESPS\f library routines that are called from \fBstats\f .
.TP
.BI \-r
Allows a specified range of records to be processed.
.TP
.BI \-e
Allows a specified range of elements to be processed.
As is usual
for ESPS programs, a range consists of two integers separated by colons,
a single integer (a range consisting of one value),
an integer followed by a colon (the number of records in the file, or the
number of elements in the vector, determines the end of the range),
or a colon followed by an integer (the default is to start the range at 1).
.TP
.BI -m
Computes the average adjusted magnitude (1/N  {sum from 1 to N} | x \- m |
where m is the average value) for each element
in the specified element range.
The information is printed in place of power.
This option cannot be used if the
input is from a pipe.
.TP
.BI \-n
Suppresses the text header line; only the values are printed.
This may make it easier to use \s-1UNIX\s+1 tools to process the output.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.PP
The following items are read from the ESPS Common File provided that
standard input isn't used.  
.IP
.I "filename - string"
.IP
This is the name of the input file.  If no input file is 
specified on the command line, \fIfilename\fP is taken to be the
input file.  If an input file is specified on the command line, 
that input file name must match \fIfilename\fP or the other 
items (below) are not read from Common. 
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
This is the starting record in the input file to begin.  It 
is not read if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.  
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
This is the number of records to process from the input file.  It is not
read if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.  A value of zero means the last
record in the file.
.sp
.PP
Again, the values of \fIstart\fR and \fInan\fR are only used if the
input file on the command line is the same as \fIfilename\fP in the
common file, or if no input file was given on the command line.  If
\fIstart\fR and/or \fInan\fR are not given in the common file, or if
the common file can't be opened for reading, then \fIstart\fR
defaults to the beginning of the file and \fInan\fR defaults to the
number of records in the file.
.PP
The following items are written into the ESPS Common file:
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The starting record from the input file.
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The number of records in the selected range.
.sp
.I "prog - string"
.IP
This is the name of the program (\fIstats\fP in this case).
.sp
.I "filename - string"
.IP
The name of the input file. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
A fatal error occurs if the input file does not exist or is not an ESPS
file.
.PP
This program does not work correctly for all types of sphere files,
and it warns and exits on them. Use \fIfea_stats\fP(1-ESPS) on sphere
format files.
