     _M_b_r_o_t computes points that are in the Mandelbrot set.   This
     is  the set of all points _Z in the complex plane such that C
     = C * C + _Z stays bounded as it is recursively repeated.

     _M_b_r_o_t produces an ESPS feature file, FEA(5-ESPS), that  con-
     tains  two  fields:  _X__p_o_s  (  type  DOUBLE) and _m_b_r_o_t (type
     SHORT).  _X__p_o_s is a scalar variable and is the x-axis  coor-
     dinate  of  the  vertical  data  vector  stored in the _m_b_r_o_t
     field.  _m_b_r_o_t is a vector of size _g_r_i_d__p_t_s + 1 (see ----gggg); the
     zeroth  element  of the _m_b_r_o_t field has y-axis coordinate of
     _b_o_t_t_o_m__e_d_g_e (see ----bbbb).  If " - "  is  supplied  in  place  of
     _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e, then standard output is used.

     The following options are supported:

     ----bbbb _b_o_t_t_o_m__e_d_g_e [-1.]
          Specifies the lower edge of the region over  which  the
          Mandelbrot set is computed.

     ----tttt _t_o_p__e_d_g_e [1.]
          Specifes the upper edge of the region  over  which  the
          Mandelbrot set is computed.

     ----llll _l_e_f_t__e_d_g_e [-1.9]
          Specifies the left edge of the region  over  which  the
          Mandelbrot set is computed.

     ----rrrr _r_i_g_h_t__e_d_g_e [.6]
          Specifies the right edge of the region over  which  the
          Mandelbrot set is computed.

     ----cccc _c_o_n_f_i_d_e_n_c_e [342]
          Specifies the  number  of  iterations  used  to  decide
          whether  the point is in the set.  That is, if after ----cccc
          specified iterations of  the  recursion  the  point  is
          still  bounded (real and imaginary parts less than 2 in
          magnitude), then the point is considered to be  in  the
          set.  The larger the _c_o_n_f_i_d_e_n_c_e factor, the sharper the
          set boundaries become (and often the  more  interesting
          the image looks).

          Specifies the number of grid cells to use  in  dividing
          the region of interest. Often, the larger the number of
          _g_r_i_d__p_t_s, the more interesting the image looks.

     ----CCCC    By default, _m_b_r_o_t returns 0 if the point is not in the
          set  and 1 if the point is in the set.  By specifying ----
          CCCC, each point is assigned a value between -64  and  50.
          Points  in the set get 50.  Proportionally lower values
          are given to all other points based on how close  there
          are to being in the set. For example, if the _c_o_n_f_i_d_e_n_c_e
          factor is 114 and the point falls out of the set  after
          90  iterations, the value given this point is 26 ( = 90
          - 64 ). To make full use of the _x_w_a_v_e_s colormaps,  make
          sure that the ----cccc specified value is an integer multiple
          of 114.

     ----xxxx    If specified, debug information is printed to stderr.

     In addition to the usual header values  for  FEA  (5 - ESPS)
     files,  _m_b_r_o_t  writes  the  following  values:  _n_u_m__g_r_i_d__p_t_s
     (LONG),   _n_u_m__i_t_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s   (LONG),    _l_e_f_t__e_d_g_e    (DOUBLE),
     _r_i_g_h_t__e_d_g_e  (DOUBLE),  _b_o_t_t_o_m__e_d_g_e  (DOUBLE), _t_o_p__e_d_g_e (DOU-

     By default, _m_b_r_o_t (1-ESPS) produces the classical fuzzy bug.
     Try the following:

          %mbrot - |  image -embrot -S500:400 -


     For a more interesting display, try

          %mbrot -C -l-1.254 -r-1.2536 -b.0234 -t.0238  - g800  -
          c798 - |
          tofspec -fmbrot - mbrot.fspec&

     This will take a while to complete, but when it is done  use
     _x_w_a_v_e_s to view the FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS) file.

     In general, the more interesting images  are  found  on  the
     edges of the set.
