.SH SYNOPSIS

[

.BI \-t tag
] [
.BI \-f field_name

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pspsdiff
is a shell script which compares the \fIpsps\fP(1\-ESPS) listings of two
ESPS files.  All options of \fIpsps\fP(1\-ESPS) are supported.
Diff(1) is used to print the output on stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.B \-a
Compare every parameter in every subheader.  Use of
this option along with \fB\-v\fR forces comparison of all information
contained in the two ESPS files.
.TP
.B \-D
Suppress printing of data records. Compares header information only.
.TP
.BI \-f " field_name"
Compares only the feature file field that matches the given field name.
A warning is printed on stderr if the requested field name does not
exist.  This option may be specified as often as desired.
.TP
.B \-g
Comparison is made by printing the ESPS files in a generic format.
.TP
.B \-h
Compare the common part of all embedded headers in the file.
.TP
.B \-H
Suppress comparison of header information. Compares record information only.
.TP
.B \-l
Compare all the parameters in the header of the file, except for included
subheaders.
.TP
.BI \-r " start:end"
.TP
.BI \-r " start:+incr
Determines the range of data records to compare.  In the first form, a
pair of unsigned integers gives the first and last points of the range.  
If 
.I start
is omitted, 1 is used.  If 
.I end
is omitted, the last point in the file is used.  The second form is
equivalent to the first with 
.I "end = start + incr".
.TP
.BI \-t " tag"
Only compare the data record with the corresponding tag.
A warning message is printed if this option is specified and the data
is not tagged.  This option may be specified as many times as
desired.
.TP
.B \-v
This option enables comparison of feature file field definitions. Otherwise
feature file field definitions are not compared, even if the \fB\-l\fR
option is used.   Using this option also sets the \fB\-l\fR.  Use of
this option along with \fB\-a\fR forces comparison of all information
contained in the two ESPS files.
.TP
.B \-x
Compare debug output.
.SH BUGS
Options that take an argument (i.e., \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-r\fP, and \fB\-t\fP)
require a space between the option and the argument.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The program bombs if the specified files does not exist, or if
the files are not ESPS files.
