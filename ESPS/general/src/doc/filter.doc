       1 .  INTRODUCTION


            The Entropic Signal Processing System (ESPS) contains  a  variety
       of programs used in the digital filtering of sampled data.  This docu-
       ment introduces the reader to programs that deal  with  filtering  and
       illustrates their use through some common examples.

            With release 4.2 and greater of ESPS, the FILT (5-ESPS) file type
       has  been  replaced by the FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file type. Filter programs
       in this release will not work on filter  files  designed  by  previous
       releases  of  the  software,  and filters designed with release 4.2 of
       ESPS will not  work  with  filter  programs  from  previous  releases.
       Conversion  routines  are  provided,  however, to convert from the old
       FILT (5-ESPS) format to the new  FEAFILT  (5-ESPS)  format,  and  vice
       versa.  filt2fea  (1-ESPS)  converts from old filter files to new, and
       fea2filt (1-ESPS) converts from new filter files to old.

            Digital filters are  characterized  by  their  coefficients.   In
       ESPS, these coefficients are usually stored in FEAFILT (5-ESPS) files.
       Programs that create FEAFILT (5-ESPS) files are called  filter  design
       programs.   These  are  discussed  in  Section  2.   Programs that use
       FEAFILT (5-ESPS) files to perform the digital filtering operation  are
       called  filtering  programs,  and  Section 3 describes these programs.
       Finally, Section 4 discusses programs used to calculate and  plot  the
       frequency  response  or  transfer  function  of  the coefficients in a
       FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file.

       1 .2 .  Library Functions

            The following ESPS library functions support the use of  filters.
       Library functions are not discussed in this document.  The user should
       refer to the appropriate section 3 manual page for further  help  with
       filtering library functions.

       init_feafilt_hd (3-ESPS)- Initalize a FEA file header for subtpe FEAFILE.

       pz_to_co (3-ESPS)   - Convert pole or zero locations to filter coefficients.


       2 .  FILTER DESIGN

            There are two kinds of filters often dicsussed in the  literature
       and  text  books:   finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse
       response (IIR).  FIR filters have only numerator coefficients, and are
       sometimes called moving-average or all-zero filters.  IIR filters have
       denominator (and possibly numerator) coefficients, and are also called
       recursive  filters.   ESPS  programs  provide  design support for both
       types of filters, and this section describes those programs that  cal-
       culate filter coefficients and store them in FEAFILT (5-ESPS) files.


       2 .1 .  notch_filt

            The program notch_filt (5-ESPS) designs a second order IIR filter
       that  removes or "notches out" a narrow region in the frequency domain
       and passes all other frequencies.  This is done by placing a  zero  on
       the  unit circle in the Z-plane at a point corresponding to this notch


       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91







       FILTERING APPLICATIONS NOTE                                     page 3


       frequency, and then placing a pole very close to it  and  just  inside
       the  unit  circle.   The  complex conjugates of this pole and zero are
       also included to guarantee a filter with real coefficients.  The  fre-
       quency response will therefore be zero when evaluated at the zero fre-
       quencies, but nearly everywhere else on the unit circle,  the  effects
       of the poles and zeroes will cancel.

            To use notch_filt , the user must specify the sampling frequency,
       the  notch  frequency, the notch bandwidth, and, of course, the output
       file name.  The notch bandwidth is defined as  the  distance  (in  the
       frequency  domain)  between  the  -6  dB. points on either side of the
       notch.  The three critical frequencies may be specified on the command
       line  or  in a parameter file.  If all three are specified on the com-
       mand line, no parameter file is necessary.

       2 .1 .1 .  notch_filt Example.

            To illustrate the use of notch_filt, a filter will be designed to
       remove  120  Hz  noise  from 8 kHz. sampled data.  The notch bandwidth
       will be 20 Hz.  The command for this is:

           notch_filt -s8000 -n120 -b20 notch120.filt

































       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91

            The response for the resulting filter (in the file  notch120.filt
       )  is  shown  in  Figure 2-1.  The commands used to obtain the plot in
       Figure 2-1 are covered in section 4.

                     Figure 2-1: Filter designed by notch_filt.


       2 .2 .  wmse_filt


            The program wmse_filt (5-ESPS) designs an FIR filter of specified
       length  using  the  weighted  mean-square-error  criterion.   The user
       specifies a desired frequency response and a  weighting  function  and
       the program finds the set of filter coefficients whose response minim-
       izes the mean square error with respect to the desired response,  when
       weighted  by  the  weighting  function.   In  other words, for desired
       response D(f) and weighting function W(f), the program finds the coef-
       ficients of the filter H(f) which minimizes:

             integral (from -W to W) of |D(f)-H(f)|(squared) * W(f) df

       If uniform weighting is used ( i.e. W(f) = 1 ), the  solution  to  the
       above  equation  will simply be the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
       of D(f), truncated to the desired number of coefficients.

            The user may specify the desired response and weighting  function
       in one of two modes: prompt and points.

            In "prompt mode" the program assumes that  the  desired  response
       and  the  weighting function are constant throughout a set of adjacent
       frequency bands from zero to half the sampling frequency.  The user is
       prompted  on standard output for the sampling frequency, the number of
       frequency bands,  the  edges  of  each  band,  the  desired  magnitude
       response  of each band, and the weighting value of each band. The user
       enters these values on standard input.  The first band  always  starts
       at  zero and the last band always ends at half the sampling frequency.
       Since the bands are assumed  contiguous,  the  user  will  only  enter
       nbands+1 edges for nbands bands.

            In "points mode" the program  allows  the  desired  response  and
       weighting  function  to be arbitrarily shaped and to be specified at a
       number of uniformly spaced points from zero to half the sampling  fre-
       quency.   The  number  of points must be one plus a power of two.  The
       point values of the desired response and the  weighting  function  are
       specified in two ASCII files.  The first number in each of these files
       is an integer telling how many point values are in the file,  and  the
       point  values follow.  Data in both files may be separated by any com-
       bination of spaces or newlines.  The desired  response  data  and  the
       weighting  function  data  may  be in the same file, in which case the
       desired response comes first and the same  file  name  must  be  given
       twice on the command line.




       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91







       FILTERING APPLICATIONS NOTE                                     page 5


            In either mode, points on the desired response may be negative in
       order  to  cause the resulting filter gain to be negative in that par-
       ticular region.  No part of the weighting function  may  be  negative,
       however.

            Besides being easier, the prompt mode is more accurate  than  the
       points  mode if the desired response and the weighting function are in
       the right form (i.e., piecewise constant functions).  This is  because
       the  design  algorithm  must calculate the convolution of two infinite
       time domain functions.  The prompt mode uses  an  analytical  solution
       for  this  convolution,  but  the  points mode only estimates it using
       truncated versions of the two functions.  When using the points  mode,
       the accuracy of the solution can be increased by increasing the number
       of points in the desired response and the weighting function.


       2 .2 .1 .  Prompt Mode Example.

            To illustrate the "prompt mode" of operation, a simple band  pass
       filter will be designed.  The initial command line is shown below with
       the subsequent computer prompts following in bold face and the  user's
       responses in regular type.  This example uses uniform weighting.

            This is a bandpass filter with passband from 1 Khz.

            to 2 Khz. The error was weighted uniformly.


            The response for this filter is shown in Figure 2-2.

            The user can obtain better stop band rejection  by  allowing  the
       filter  response  to  roll  off more slowly than in the above example.
       This can be accomplished with wmse_filt by specifying transition bands


       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91

       on  either  side  of  the passband, where the error is weighted with a
       factor of zero.  This allows the filter design  algorithm  to  concen-
       trate  the  zeroes  in  the regions of interest since the error in the
       transition region can grow arbitrarily  large  without  affecting  the
       total  weighted error.  Note that the desired response function is the
       same in this example as in the one above, even though it is  specified
       by using more bands.

            on either side of the passband with zero error weighting.


            The response for this filter is shown in Figure 2-3.   Note  that
       the passband ripple has been reduced and the stop band attenuation has
       been increased by about 30 dB.

       2 .2 .2 .  Points Mode Example.

            In this section, a more complicated filter will be designed using
       the  "points  mode"  method. Suppose a filter with the characteristics
       shown in Figure 2-4 is  desired.   This  filter,  with  the  amplitude
       response  proportional  to frequency over the range of interest, could
       be used as an FM demodulation filter. The weighting function shown  in
       Figure 2-5 will again allow for a transition band.

            Before the filter can be designed, ASCII files  must  be  created
       containing  the desired response and the weighting function.  For best
       results, the number of points in  these  functions  should  be  large.
       These  ASCII  files can be created easily by using the Masscomp utili-
       ties gas (1G) and af  (1G).   The  gas  command  creates  an  additive
       sequence  of  numbers and the af command performs arithmetic functions
       on these sequences of numbers.  For this example, only gas  is  neces-
       sary.  The desired response function shown in Figure 2-4 contains 1025
       points and is created as follows:

       cat  >  fm_des   (This puts the number of points at the beginning of the file.)
       1025
       ^d
       gas  -s0  -n820  -c1  -i0.012195121  >>  fm_des
       gas  -s10  -n100  -c1  -i-0.1  >>  fm_des
       gas  -s0  -n105  -c1  -i0  >>  fm_des


            The weighting function shown in Figure 2-5 is created below.  The
       transition  band  receives low weighting to improve performance in the
       pass band and stop band.

       cat  >  fm_wt
       1025
       ^d
       gas  -s1  -n820  -c1  -i0  >>  fm_wt
       gas  -s0.1  -n100  -c1  -i0  >>  fm_wt
       gas  -s1  -n105  -c1  -i0  >>  fm_wt


            The filter is designed with the following command:

           wmse_filt -c "FM demodulator." -n 401 -d fm_des -w fm_wt fm_demod.filt

       The comment string following the -c option will  be  copied  into  the
       comment  portion  of the output file header.  If the -c option had not
       been specified, the program would have prompted  for  comments.   This
       allows the user to conveniently enter a much longer description of the
       file contents; the comment is terminated by a control-d  on  the  last
       line.  Many ESPS filter design programs have this mechanism for adding
       comments to describe the  designed  filter.   The  response  for  this
       filter is shown on a linear scale in Figure 2-6 and a decibel scale in
       Figure 2-7.

       2 .3 .  zero_pole

            The program zero_pole (5-ESPS) allows the user to design a filter
       by  arbitrary placement of poles and zeroes in the complex plane.  The
       user simply specifies the pole and zero locations in one or two  ASCII
       files,  and the program computes the coefficients and deposits them in
       a FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file.

            The zero_pole program will be demonstrated by converting an  ana-
       log  Butterworth  filter  to its discrete equivalent by using the bil-
       inear transformation. [1] The analog filter is a sixth-order  low-pass
       filter  with  a 3-dB corner frequency at one eighth the sampling rate.
       After the transformation, in the Z-domain this filter has  six  zeroes
       at -1, and poles at the following locations:

               p0 = 0.597716978 + 0.577350268 i        p5 = p0 conjugate.
               p1 = 0.471404518 + 0.333333333 i        p4 = p1 conjugate.
               p2 = 0.420143458 + 0.108741129 i        p3 = p2 conjugate.

       The filter is then designed with the following command:

           zero_pole -c "Sixth order Butterworth." -g 1  butter6.filt  butter6  butter6


            The -g option is used above to insure  that  the  filter  coeffi-
       cients  are  normalized  to  have  unity gain at 0 Hz.  The ASCII file
       butter6 is shown below. Note that if zero and pole locations are  both
       to be read out of the same file, it must be given twice on the command
       line.  Also, for any pole or zero off of the real  axis,  the  complex
       conjugate is automatically included and therefore should not be listed
       in the input ASCII file.

       2 .4 .  impulse_resp


            The program  impulse_resp  (5-ESPS)  is  used  to  calculate  the
       impulse  response  of  a  filter.  A specified number of points on the
       impulse response are  calculated  and  written  either  to  an  output
       FEAFILT  (5-ESPS) file, to be used as an FIR filter, or to an SD (sam-
       pled data) file for plotting in the time domain.  As an  example,  the
       Butterworth  filter  designed in the last section will be converted to
       an FIR filter using impulse_resp.

            To obtain another FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file from butter6.filt:

           impulse_resp -n 100  butter6.filt  butter6_fir.filt


            The response for this filter is shown in Figure 2-9.  If the user
       wishes  to plot the impulse response in the time domain, the following
       command should be used to obtain an SD file:

           impulse_resp  -s  -n 100  butter6.filt  butter6_fir.sd

       This file is plotted in Figure 2-10 using plotsd (5-ESPS).

       2 .5 .  atofilt


            The program atofilt (5-ESPS) is used to convert a  set  of  known
       filter  coefficients  into  a FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file.  The coefficients
       may be placed in one or two ASCII files, or may be typed  in  directly
       from the standard input.  The user is strongly advised to use the com-
       ment facility of this program to record information about the  coeffi-
       cients in the file header.

            An example command line would be:

           atofilt  filter1.filt  filter1.num  filter1.den

       Since the -c option is not used above, the user will be  prompted  for
       his comments.

       2 .6 .  iir_filt


            The program iir_filt (5-ESPS)  designs  digital  IIR  filters  by
       first  designing Butterworth or Chebyshev analog filters and then con-
       verting them to digital filters by using the bilinear  transformation.
       Iir_filt   supports  the design of low pass (LP), high pass (HP), band
       pass (BP), and band stop (BS) filters.  The user must specify the sam-
       pling  frequency, the filter type (e.g.  Butterworth), filter response
       type (e.g. low pass), and the  order  of  the  filter.   These  design
       parameters  may  be specified in a parameter file, but the easiest way
       to design IIR filters is by invoking iir_filt with the eparam (1-ESPS)
       command. By doing this, the user is prompted for all the design param-
       eters.

            The design of a sixth-order low-pass Butterworth  filter  with  a
       3-dB  cutoff  frequency equal to 1000 Hz.  (identical to the one shown
       in Figure 2-8) is shown below to illustrate the procedure. As  before,
       the  initial  command line is shown below with the subsequent computer
       prompts following in bold face and the  user's  responses  in  regular
       type.

           eparam iir_filt Bworth6.filt


            Desired filter order. [3]:  6

            Desired sampling frequency. [8000.0]:

            Desired pass pand gain. [1.0]:

            Desired filter type: BUTTERWORTH or CHEBYSHEV1. [BUTTERWORTH]:

            Desired filter response: LP, HP, BP, or BS. [LP]:

            Only one 3-dB frequency is required for LP and HP filter designs;
       the  reply  to  the  prompt  for a second 3-dB frequency is ignored by
       iir_filt.  Also notice, several of the defaults (e.g. filter  response
       -  LP)  were  appropriate  for  the  desired filter, so simply hitting
       return is enough to specify those parameters.  The filter response  is
       shown below in Figure 2-11.

       2 .7 .  xpz


            The program xpz (1-ESPS) designs filters by allowing the user  to
       arbitrarily place poles and zeros.  The pole and zero locations can be
       specified by interactively placing poles and zeros on the  complex  Z-
       plane  by using the mouse, or by using a text editor window to specify
       their real and imagaginary parts. Changes  in  filter  characteristics
       are  immediately  displayed  in  the  filter response window.  See the
       manual page for more information.



       3 .  FILTERING PROGRAMS


            This section describes the two  programs  that  may  be  used  to
       filter   sampled  data:   filter  (5-ESPS)  and  fft_filter  (5-ESPS).
       Fft_filter (5-ESPS) works with FIR filters only, but  filter  (5-ESPS)
       works with both IIR and FIR fitlers.


       3 .1 .  filter


            The program filter (1-ESPS) is used to perform a digital  filter-
       ing  operation  on  sampled  data.   The program implements FIR or IIR
       filters and may  read its coefficients from a FEAFILT  (5-ESPS)  file,
       or from a parameter file.

            The program may also implement upsampling or downsampling filters
       to  raise or lower the sampling rate of the data.  Upsample filtering,
       or interpolation, means that the appropriate number  of  zero  samples
       are  inserted  between each data sample and the resulting data is then
       filtered to smooth the resulting data  sequence  and  interpolate  the
       values  between  the  original data values. By doing this the sampling
       rate of the signal is increased. Downsample filtering, or  decimation,
       means  that  the  signal  is first band limited by a digital filtering
       operation and then the data is decimated to the correct sampling  rate
       by  removing samples from the data sequence.  This results in a signal
       at a lower sampling rate.

            The following example converts a 48 kHz. sampled signal into a 32
       kHz. sampled signal by increasing the sampling rate to 96 kHz. (2 X 48
       kHz.), filtering the data with a 16 kHz. low pass filter, and decimat-
       ing  the  signal  down to 32 kHz. (96 kHz. / 3) by keeping every third
       sample.  The 16 kHz. low pass filter  coefficients  are  read  from  a
       FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file called interp.filt.



       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91







       FILTERING APPLICATIONS NOTE                                    page 17


           filter  -i 2/3  -Finterp.filt  speech48.sd  speech32.sd

       It is assumed here that the FEAFILT (5-ESPS) file interp.filt contains
       only  one filter record.  This means that it is unnecessary to use the
       -f option, which specifies the set  of  coefficients  in  the  FEAFILT
       (5-ESPS) file to use.

            In the above example, the starting point and the number of points
       to  process from the input sampled data file are read from the parame-
       ter file  below.   Setting  nan  =  0  will  cause  all  the  data  in
       speech48.sd to be processed.

       Contents of params:

       # This file processes all of the data.
       int start = 1 : "Starting point for analysis.";
       int nan = 0 : "Number of points to process.";


            The following command reads IIR filter coefficients from a param-
       eter  file  and  filters the data.  This time the sampling rate of the
       output file matches that of the input file.  Note that the filter must
       be  named  on  the  command line to extract the correct set of coeffi-
       cients from the parameter file.

           filter    -P    params.filt     -f    low_pass     brian_speech.sd
       fbrian_speech.sd

       The parameter file params.filt is shown below.  In  this  example  the
       filtering operation begins at the 10,000th point in the input file and
       processes 20,000 points.

       Contents of params.filt:

       # Don't do the whole file.
       int start = 10000 : "Starting point for analysis.";
       int nan = 20000 : "Number of points to process.";

       # Define the filter.  Third order Butterworth.
       int low_pass_nsiz = 4 : "Number of numerator coefficients. ";
       int low_pass_dsiz = 2 : "Number of denominator coefficients. ";
       float low_pass_num = {0.166666, 0.5, 0.5, 0.166666} : "Numerator coefficients.";
       float low_pass_den = {1.0, 0.33333} : "Denominator coefficients. ";



       3 .2 .  fft_filter

            The program fft_filter (5-ESPS) implements FIR  filtering  opera-
       tions  on  sampled data by performing the convolution in the frequency
       domain rather in the time domain as filter does.   This  algorithm  is
       computationally  more  efficient  than  that  used  by filter when the
       number of filter coefficients is large.  If N  is the number  of  data
                                                    1

       1.5                              ERL                           7/31/91







       FILTERING APPLICATIONS NOTE                                    page 18


       points  to  process  and  N   is  the  size of the filter, the regular
       filtering algorithm require2 on the order of N N  multiplications.  By
       contrast   the  algorithm  used  by  fft_filte1 2requires  only  about
       2N logN +N  multiplications. [1] In experimental results on a Masscomp
       5610  s2st1m,  filtering 100,000 samples, fft_filter required only one
       eighth as much time as filter to implement a 401 point filter and 25 %
       less time to implement a 51 point filter.  In implementing an 11 point
       filter, however, fft_filter was only half as fast as filter.

            The command below illustrates the use of fft_filter.   Note  that
       if the -F option is used to specify the filter coefficients and the -p
       option is used to specify the range of data points, no parameter  file
       is necessary.  The command below causes all of the data in the file to
       be processed.

           fft_filter -F low_pass.filt -p1:  input.sd  output.sd



       4 .  FILTER SPECTRAL RESPONSES

            The program filtspec (5-ESPS)  is  used  to  find  the  frequency
       response  of  a filter.  The program reads coefficients from a FEAFILT
       (5-ESPS) file and produces an output FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS) file.  The pro-
       gram plotspec (5-ESPS) can then be used to plot the response on a ter-
       minal or printer.

            Here are the commands used to produce the  plots  shown  in  this
       document.
