              waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes

                Document Version: 1.1 2/1/93

1.  INTRODUCTION

This new release of waves+,  prepared  for  distribution  in
January  1993, provides new features requested by our custo-
mers.  It also provides fixes to many bugs  and  removal  of
numerous annoyances.  In addition, the software and documen-
tation improvements embodied in this release are part of the
groundwork  for  significant feature enhancements to come in
future releases.


1.1.  Version 3.1 Release Highlights

   + xchart: a new display  method  for  lattices  of  time-
     series labels

   + full editing and display support for aperiodically sam-
     pled time series

   + streamlined software license facilities

   + improved control of output file destinations

   + enhanced control over "server mode" operation

   + greatly improved D/A and A/D (play and record) programs

   + enhanced scrolling and random access in long data files

   + xspectrum now permits FFT's of unlimited size

   + fine-grained control of harmonic spectrum cursors

   + enhanced xwaves startup environment and control panels

   + updated documentation


1.2.  Compatibility with Previous Versions

Xwaves is backwards compatible with  Version  2.1  with  the
following exceptions:

The program xwaves now has only one  official  name.   Simi-
larly, the attachments, xspectrum, xlabel, xchart and xmarks
have only one official name each.  We provide  an  installa-
tion  option  to  generate  symbolic  links  to  the various
aliases (xvwaves, waves+, xwaves+, ...),  but  we  encourage
you  to  join  us in eliminating this confusion once and for










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 2


all!  The name waves+ is now used only to refer to the  col-
lection  of  programs and documentation comprising the whole
product.

xwaves is only available for use with the X  window  system.
The Sunview version is no longer available.

The display server potential of  xwaves  has  been  signifi-
cantly  increased  by  allowing  send_xwaves  to  block  (by
default) until the sent command is complete.  Shell  scripts
that  counted  on non-blocking behavior should be changed by
inserting the -B  command-line  option  in  the  send_xwaves
calls.

Wcheckout has been eliminated.  All  auxiliary  xwaves  pro-
grams now run whether xwaves is running or not.  This should
make life more pleasant, but if you have  old  UNIX  scripts
that ran wcheckout, you should remove these calls.

Filenames entered into xwaves no longer have "./"  automati-
cally   prepended  to  the  internal  representation.   This
behavior caused subquent references  to  files  loaded  into
xwaves to be incorrect, since the user had no way of knowing
that the name (as far as xwaves was concerned) had a leading
"./".   This  fixes  apparent bugs in several commands (e.g.
align) that reference specific files.  If you worked  around
this  deficiency in your shell scripts or send_xwaves calls,
you may need to remove the leading "./"  from  scripts  that
reference these files.

The programs wplay and wrecord have been replaced by v32play
and v32record, respectively.  These provide dual-channel D/A
and A/D with the AT&T/Heurikon SURF VME board,  and  provide
single-channel play and record for the old AT&T dsp32 "FAB2"
board.  The new programs read/write  directly  from/to  disk
and have several other improvements.

The  scope  of  the   xwaves   parameters   image_clip   and
image_range  has  been  broadened to include adjustments for
color/greyscale systems.  Formerly,  these  only  influenced
the  intensity  mapping for monochrome dithered spectrograms
and   images.    Since   they   now   provide   control   of
color/greyscale  as well, you may discover that the settings
in your personal .wave_pro profile or in the default profile
found  in  $ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/.wave_pro  are  not  to your
taste.  Increasing image_clip darkens the image;  decreasing
image_range increases the contrast.

You may now have to find some other reason to take long cof-
fee  breaks; we've eliminated three.  Xwaves and the attach-
ments can no longer hang up the mouse and monitor.  Previous
versions  occasionally  did  this,  requiring  you  to login
remotely or reboot your system to regain  control.   Another










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 3


impact   on   coffee  breaks  comes  from  the  new  program
freewaves.  Previously, if xwaves exited ungracefully,  e.g.
by  a  UNIX  kill command, the license was left occupied for
three minutes.  It is now left for only 30 seconds,  and  if
this  is  too long, just issue the freewaves command to free
it immediately.  Finally, the license  control  daemon  elmd
now  only requires one minute to initialize, rather than the
three minutes required in Version 2.1.


2.  NEW FEATURES

The primary aim of the Version 3.1 release of waves+  is  to
fix problems and ro make the overall operation of the system
smoother.  This also lays the groundwork for major  enhance-
ments  to  come  later in the Spring of 1993.  Entropic has,
however added the new features listed below to Version 3.1.


2.1.  xwaves

The xwaves spectrogram  command  now  has  four  additional,
optional  arguments.  The keywords height and width (in pix-
els) permit specification of the presentation dimensions  on
the  screen.  If horizontal and vertical rescale are enabled
(with h_spect_rescale and v_spect_rescale), the  spectrogram
will  be scaled to fit the requested dimensions.  If scaling
is disabled, the spectrogram display will  either  clip  the
data  image  or be limted in maximum size to the data image.
The new keywords  range  and  threshold  provide  means  for
specifying  the  intensity mapping parameters when the spec-
trogram is created.  Previously, this was only available via
the separate colormap command.

A new time display mode has been added to xwaves.  When  the
cursor  is  in  the  scrollbar  region  near  the top of the
display, the time readout is now for the  whole  file.  This
allows  accurate  direct  access  to any part of the signal.
Note that the time/frequency cursor is now frozen  when  the
mouse  is in the scrollbar region.  The "Time:" item changes
to "Time(f):" when the mouse is  in  the  scrollbar  region.
Thus: if it is necessary to scroll to a particular time in a
long file: move the mouse pointer into the scrollbar region;
move  it  right  or  left until the "Time(f):" display reads
approximately the desired time; press the middle mouse  but-
ton.  The desired time will then be centered in the display.

The startup environment invoked by the .wave_pro entry
    init_file  $ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/commands/xw_init.WC
has been improved.  (This init_file is what  brings  up  the
"Miscellaneous  xwaves  Controls"  button  panel.)   Changes
include:











waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 4


   + spectral averaging can be added to image menus

   + hardcopy ESPS plots can be added to menus

   + some buttons are now menu-buttons to provide shortcuts

   + there's a quick way to turn rescale on and off

   + when plot3d is added, server mode is enabled

Xwaves now reads, displays, edits and writes ESPS tagged FEA
files  correctly.   This means xwaves can be used to manipu-
late any aperiodically-sampled time series.  It also  aligns
these  correctly with other data types.  Thus, all ESPS sig-
nal files, including those produced by programs like lpcana,
may  now  be  displayed  correctly  using  xwaves.  The ESPS
manual describes how to write ESPS tagged files from C  pro-
grams.   If  you have aperiodic data in ASCII form generated
by some non-ESPS process, you can build a tagged  ESPS  file
acceptable  to  xwaves  and ESPS programs with a UNIX script
like the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# $1    data type: DOUBLE, FLOAT, LONG, or SHORT
# $2    size: number of elements per record (columns), not counting tag
# $3    src_sf: sampling frequency of the data to which the tags refer
# $4    input: name of ASCII input file
# $5    output: name of output tagged FEA file

# The first column in the input file contains the "tags".  These are
# sample (record) indices into the file from which the remaining columns
# were derived.  This "source" file was sampled at "src_sf" samples per
# second.  This script assumes the remaining columns are all of the data
# type specified by $1.

# data will not be necessary in future Entropic software releases.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


The initial adjustments for the spectrogram threshold  level
and displayed dynamic range may now be set on both color and
monochrome systems using the image_clip and image_range glo-
bals.  These are established in the .wave_pro profile or via
an xwaves set command.  When the color map is adjusted using
the  middle mouse button in the spectrogtram display window,
the values of image_clip and image_range are updated accord-
ingly.   The current value of them may be retrieved with the
get attributes command.  Image_range  is  identical  to  the
range  variable  settable  via  the colormap and spectrogram
commands.  Image_clip is related to threshold via  the  for-
mula:
             threshold = 105 - image_clip - image_range
This somewhat convoluted variable set was devised  to  main-
tain backward compatability while providing a degree of con-
trol needed by many users.


2.2.  Auxiliary Programs

All Entropic D/A conversion (play) programs, when used  with
xwaves,  support  the  feature  that  repositions the signal
display centered on the point at which the  playback  opera-
tion  is  interrupted  by a left button press in the display
window.  A simple modification to non-Entropic D/A programs,
documented  in  the  splay  manual  page,  will provide this
interrupt-and-reposition function for them as well.  To  use
this  feature  on  a  long file, only a fraction of which is
displayed in a xwaves window: Select a play  function,  like
"play  entire  file",  from the data window menu.  Allow the
playback to proceed until you hear the  point  of  interest.
Immediately  press  the left button in the data window.  D/A
will stop and the window will jump  to  roughly  center  the
point of interest in the display.

Send_xwaves will now wait for a command to  complete  before
proceeding.   The utility of send_xwaves was previously lim-
ited by its completely asynchronous  coupling  with  xwaves.
Commands  via  send_xwaves are now executed and completed in
the order in which they are given.  This feature extends  to










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 7


commands that involve other processes external to xwaves and
to the attachments.  If  the  old  asynchronous  send_xwaves
behavior  is desired, the interlock may be disabled with the
-B send-xwaves command-line option.  See the new send_xwaves
manual page.

All Entropic A/D (record) programs  optionally  can  send  a
display  message  to  xwaves  to  display  the  signal  just
recorded.  This simplifies recording followed immediately by
analysis  or editing.  To use this feature: Have xwaves run-
ning in the server mode (e.g. start it with the -s  option).
Issue a record command, like "srecord -S output.sd".  If the
record operation is then interrupted or allowed  to  run  to
completion,  the  data  just  collected  will  be  displayed
immediately in an xwaves window.  See the srecord manual for
more details.


2.3.  Attachments

There is a new attachment called xchart.  This  has  all  of
the features present in the xlabel program, plus the ability
to handle segment lattice displays.  These displays  consist
of  multiple,  possibly overlapping, segment labels, such as
might be generated by an automatic time-series labeling sys-
tem, or a speech recognizer "front end".  See the new xchart
manual page.

Xspectrum now controls the highest visible  harmonic  cursor
when  harmonic cursors are on.  The mouse cursor keeps jump-
ing to higher and higher harmonics as the frequency  of  the
fundamental is lowered, and to lower harmonics as the funda-
mental is raised.  The maximum number  of  harmonic  cursors
has  been increased to 20.  Thus, it is now possible to make
extremely  accurate  fundamental  frequency   determinations
using xspectrum.

Xspectrum now provides  on/off  control  of  the  horizontal
(magnitude) cursors.  It is often desirable to disable these
when hard copies are being prepared.


3.  ANNOYANCES REMOVED

3.1.  xwaves

Xwaves now has only one name: xwaves.  We no longer put  the
names   waves,   xvwaves,   xwaves+,   waves+,  ...  in  the
$ESPS_BASE/bin directory.  We also no longer supply a cover-
ing  script  that attempts to determine the window system in
use.  When you run xwaves, you will be  running  the  target
binary  file  designed  for the window system named X.  Some
installations may wish to  continue  to  link  the  multiple










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 8


names  to  xwaves, but Entropic has decided to cut the cord!
We are sorry if this causes temporary inconvenience, but  it
will simplify all our lives in the long run.  We were conti-
nally finding that, through our fault or  theirs,  customers
were  actually  running  the  wrong  version of our software
because links had turned into copies, etc.  We suggest  uni-
formly  changing  all  references in scripts, etc to xwaves.
(Note, however, that command  files  interpreted  by  xwaves
should continue to send messages to "waves" as before.)

Xwaves now recognizes any homogeneous ESPS FEA file  with  a
field called "F0" as a file containing fundamental-frequency
(pitch) information.  These are now displayed using the  F0-
specific  method, appropriate for such signals.  If the file
also has a field called  "P(voice)"  or  "prob_voice",  this
signal  element  will  be  used  to  enable the the waveform
display of the F0 data.  Data records in which prob_voice is
>  .5,  will  have F0 displayed.  This behavior was formerly
only available when the pitch information was stored in  the
AT&T SIGnal format.  The formant program now only optionally
emits the extra SIGnal version of the pitch data  (i.e.  the
.f0.sig file).

The use of the UNIX environment variable DEF_HEADER and  the
internal  xwaves variable def_header has been made more con-
sistent and more clearly defined: If DEF_HEADER  is  defined
before  xwaves  is  run, its value will be adopted by xwaves
(def_header will be set to its value).  If def_header is set
in  xwaves  AFTER  xwaves  is  started,  all programs run BY
xwaves (i.e. as child processes) will inherit the new defin-
ition.   Thus,  it  is possible to change def_header between
calls to external programs (e.g. calls via D/A play commands
or  add_espsf)  and  have the external ESPS programs use the
new definition.

The limit on the number of files that may  be  specified  on
the  command  line as signals for xwaves to display has been
raised from seven to 50.

The data-display cursor now returns to its  pre-menu-display
position after a window menu selection is performed.

Xwaves now scales signals for D/A playback based on the gen-
eric  header  item  max_val,  if  it is present, rather than
based on only the maximum found in the display  buffer.   If
max_val  is not present, xwaves assumes the maximum value is
32767 and does not scale at all.

It is no longer necessary to have fea_sd_special set to  get
reasonable  behavior  on  non-short-integer  data  with  the
built-in  boards  (or  external  program  calls,  for   that
matter).   Thus,  one  can  display a floating-point file as
floating point and still play it from within xwaves.  (It is










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                      page 9


still necessary to set fea_sd_special to get spectrograms of
non-short-integer data with the built-in boards).


3.2.  Auxiliary Programs

All Entropic play programs now read the input and send  out-
put  to  the D/A simultaneously.  Previously, splay and some
of the others, read the entire file before beginning, a par-
ticularly annoying trait when the file was an hour long!

Similarly,  all  Entropic  record  programs  send  the  data
directly  to  disk  as  the data comes in from the A/D.  All
record programs can write to stdout.

The play programs (splay, sgplay,  s32cplay,  c30play,  ...)
now read ESPS files or headerless files correctly from stan-
dard input.  Thus, command sequences like
                   testsd -C 1000 -s4 - | splay -
will work as expected.

Formant now permits specification of  an  output  directory,
rather  than  requiring  that the output files it creates be
placed in the same directory as the input  file.   This  was
implemented  as an optional command-line argument "-O" where
the directory path may be  specified.   Formant  still  gen-
erates  several  files  with  names ending in .hp, .sd, same
directory with the input file.  if "-O"  is  not  specified,
the old behavior obtains.

Formant now supports the standard  ESPS  range  [-r]  option
making  it  easier  to integrate with xwaves add_espsf func-
tions.  It still requires a covering  script  for  add_espsf
implementation,  but  the operation is more efficient, since
less copying will be required and the use of  copysd  is  no
longer  necessary  to obtain the range limits.  See the for-
mant manual page for examples.  The algorithms  embodied  in
the  formant program will be reimplemented for greater speed
and to provide a more regular I/O syntax in the Spring  1993
release.

Formant no longer forces the creation of a SIGnal file  con-
taining  the F0 information, since xwaves now reads the ESPS
version of this data correctly.  Thus only the  ".f0"  files
are  created by default. These are now read and displayed by
xwaves exactly as the ".f0.sig" files were.  Users requiring
the  SIGnal  files  for  other  reasons  can  use  the  [-S]
command-line option to enable the old behavior.

Formant now uses the standard UNIX getopt() function to pro-
cess  the  command  line,  making  it  insensitive to spaces
between option switches and their arguments, etc.











waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                     page 10


Processing of commands sent to xwaves  via  send_xwaves  was
overly  restrictive  about the format of the command string.
Its unnecessary sensitivity to the presence  or  absence  of
whitespace and newlines has now been eliminated.

All xwaves file name specifications are  now  processed  for
possible  UNIX  environment  symbols of the form $NAME.  All
such symbols are now expanded correctly.

Wcheckout has been eliminated.  If  the  user  has  a  valid
waves+  license,  all  of  the  auxiliary programs will run,
whether  xwaves  is  running  or  not.   All  references  to
wcheckout in scripts, etc. may be eliminated.

The program  wplay  has  been  replaced  by  a  new  program
v32play. This new program provides D/A conversion via either
the AT&T FAB2 dsp32 board  or  the  AT&T  or  Heurikon  SURF
dsp32c board.  Unlike wplay, v32play reads its data directly
from disk files (or stdin) during conversion,  and  is  thus
much  faster  in  response.  It may also be used on files of
unlimited length.  V32play behaves like  all  of  the  other
Entropic  D/A  programs,  with respect to command-line argu-
ments and UNIX signals (see eman v32play).   With  the  SURF
board,  v32play  provides both single- and dual-channel out-
put.

The AT&T/Heurikon SURF record  program,  wrecord,  has  been
replaced   by  the  program  v32record  which  performs  A/D
directly to disk (unlike wrecord which  buffered  everything
to  memory first).  V32record also records either single- or
dual-channel signals.


3.3.  Attachments

As with xwaves, we have uniformly singled out names for  all
of  the  attachments.   Thus,  we  retain  the names xlabel,
xspectrum and xmarks.  All references to  these  attachments
must  use  those names.  Optionally, your site may choose to
symbolically link the old names (like xvlabel) to  the  now-
standard  names.   However,  we  encourage  you  to make the
change now.  We promise never to change the names again!

Attachment of an xlabel window to a particular xwaves signal
view  has  now  been correctly implemented.  When the xlabel
display is created by a command like
        send make  name foo   file foo.lab   signal foo.sd
the xlabel window remains connected to the  foo.sd  display,
regardless  of  other signals that may subsequently included
in  the  foo  display  ensemble.   If  several  signals  are
included  in  foo,  and  the original signal (foo.sd in this
case) is removed, xlabel reverts  to  the  old  behavior  of
attaching to the most recently created signal display.










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                     page 11


The xspectrum "Window  Limits  From:"  panel  item  has  new
choice  labels to more clearly reflect the semantics of this
control item.
Now: "Cursor +- step/2" and "Markers"
Was: "Local" and "Host"

Xspectrum no longer repositions the  markers  or  recomputes
the  spectrum  if the "Window limits from:" item is changed.
Formerly, if the markers had been  carefully  positioned  in
preparation  for  a  new  spectrum computation, and the user
then switched the limits source, the hand-set window  limits
would be lost.


4.  BUGS FIXED

4.1.  xwaves

Commands added to the xwaves menus by the add_espsf facility
previously  did  not handle multiple output files correctly.
Now, if a process creates several related output time series
as  the  result of operations on an xwaves signal, these may
all be displayed automatically.  (See the discussion of out-
puts under the add_esps command in the xwaves manual.)

Multiple views of the same  signal  in  xwaves  now  display
correctly.   There  was a bug that caused incorrect displays
to be generated if more than one view of the same signal was
generated  in  the  display ensemble.  Now it is possible to
have several views of the same signal displayed correctly at
different scales.

When xwaves was being used to manipulate  headerless  files,
or  files  with  foreign headers, it would eventually use up
all available file descriptors and  refuse  to  display  any
more  files.   This has been corrected.  An unlimited number
of cycles of load and destroy may now be performed  on  such
files.

The verbose startup messages issued by xwaves regarding  the
use  of  DSP  hardware  were  often confusing (or just plain
wrong).  These are now correct.

The xwaves file-browser  windows  did  not  follow  symbolic
directory links correctly.  This has now been corrected.

The xwaves file-browser facility would fail to detect that a
typed  specification  was a directory unless a final "/" was
entered.  As a consequence, xwaves would load such nodes  as
though  they  were  signals!   All  directory  nodes are now
displayed as directories whether entered  with,  or  without
the trailing "/".











waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                     page 12


When xwaves exited before a  "play"  command  was  complete,
some types of internal DSP hardware were not reset correctly
and would endlessly repeat fragments  of  the  output.   All
play  operations  in  progress are now stopped before xwaves
exits.

Previously, the SGI Indigo internal "play"  function  locked
out  xwaves  interaction for the duration of the play opera-
tion.  This has now been fixed.  The workaround for this had
been to use the external play program (sgplay) as the defin-
ition for play_prog.  This has  the  disadvantage  of  being
somewhat  slower,  so SGI users that resorted to this should
now comment out the play_prog specifications in their


4.2.  Auxiliary Programs

A/D and D/A conversion on the SGI Indigo is now possible for
all  Indigo  sample rates for stereo and mono files.  Previ-
ously, a bug in our buffer specifications prevented  correct
operation at frequencies over 24kHz.

Dual-channel play on  SURF  from  within  xwaves  now  works
correctly.  Several other play deficiencies in FAB2 and SURF
xwaves play operations were also fixed.

The xwaves-internal play function has been fixed  to  handle
non-ESPS  files  correctly  when the played region is not in
display window.  Formerly this could cause  extreme  distor-
tion due to variances in data type or byte ordering.

Xwaves now  handles  incorrect  colormap  names  gracefully.
Previously,  it  would  load the current directory (!!) as a
colormap if the specified  colormap  didn't  exist,  causing
bizarre spectrogram displays.

Single-record FEA_SPECT files may now be displayed as  spec-
trograms.  Previously, this caused a core dump.

There were several situations which caused  xwaves  to  exit
without freeing the Entropic license.  This prevented subse-
quent use of that license until after a three-minute timeout
period.   This  has  now  been fixed for all cases except an
explicit SIGKILL (e.g. via kill -9 <pid>).  A  new  command,
freewaves, has been added to handle this latter case and the
timeout period has been reduced to 30 seconds.

Xwaves now  uses  the  output_dir  specification  much  more
rationally:  If  the  user  specifies a fully qualified name
(i.e as beginning with a directory, ./ or /)  output_dir  is
ignored.   Output_dir  is only applied to automatically gen-
erated names (e.g. temporary files) and those  output  files
specified as simple base names by the user.










waves+ Version 3.1 Release Notes                     page 13


Simple filenames entered into xwaves  no  longer  have  "./"
automatically  prepended.   This  behavior  caused  subquent
references to files loaded  into  xwaves  to  be  incorrect,
since  the  user had no way of knowing that the name (as far
as xwaves was concerned) had a  leading  "./".   This  fixes
apparent  bugs  in several commands (e.g. align) that refer-
ence specific files.

If the start and end time specifications for  a  spectrogram
command  are  omitted,  the spectrogram will now be computed
over the entire xwaves buffer interval automatically.   Pre-
viously, if these were omitted, no spectrogram was computed.
Users who resorted to the workaround of  setting  start  0.0
and  end  10000  (or  some  such)  may  now revert to a more
rational model if they wish.  In fact, if the file is  10000
seconds long, the new xwaves will compute the whole spectro-
gram, so be careful!

In some cases the temporary files created during computation
of  spectrograms  by  xwaves-external processes were getting
crossed up so  that  the  spectrogram  that  was  eventually
displayed was not of the desired signal.

Formerly, spectrogram segments  saved  using  xwaves'  "save
segment  in  file"  facility,  were  not saved correctly and
could not be used  with  many  Entropic  programs  (such  as
plotsgram).  This has been fixed.

Quantization by xwaves of the start and end  times  sent  to
external spectrogram programs would cause these to fail with
messages about bad start and/or end times.  This was partic-
ularly  troublesome  for  files  with start and/or end times
greater than 99 sec.  The spectrogram programs (e.g.  sgram,
s32csgram)  have relaxed their requirements by simply limit-
ing the spectrogram computation to the file limits if neces-
sary.   Also, the quantization of the time specifications by
xwaves has been made much finer.

Temporary waveform files created by the spectrogram  command
are now placed in output_dir, and are automatically deleted.

Previously, spectrogram computations launched by xwaves, but
executed by an external program (such as sgram) were limited
to signal segments that were buffered in xwaves.   That  is,
if  an  external program is called to compute a spectrogram,
the entire segment upon which it was to be based  needed  to
be  present  in xwaves' display buffer. In Version 3.1, seg-
ments of any size consistent with the  limits  of  the  file
being  analyzed  may  now be specified for the start and end
values to the spectrogram command.  Specifications exceeding
the file limits will be automatically adjusted as necessary.

4.3.  Attachments

The tendency for xwaves and the attachments to hang  up  the
computer's  mouse  and  display  has  now  been  eliminated.
Xwaves and the attachments can no longer "grab all input".

The tendency for xwaves and the attachments  to  loose  syn-
chronization  has been greatly reduced.  A new inter-process
communication technique  has  been  implemented  that  makes
interactions  faster  and  less error prone.  Problems elim-
inated include: negative times being printed in  the  xlabel
window; failure of label files to load correctly; lock up of
attachments; and failure to execute commands.

Previously, the xlabel and xmarks label displays  positioned
themselves to overlap the signal view and obscured the lower
part of its window.  This has been corrected.

Xlabel now automatically inherits the current display ensem-
ble  name  from xwaves.  This eliminates the "Object doesn't
exist (can't add file ...)" message from xlabel  (unless  it
is really true!).

When  output_dir  is  specified,  xlabel  now   applies   it
correctly.   Previously,  two  bugs  caused  bizarre  things
(including core dumps) when  output_dir  was  specified  and
xlabel was used.  Now, if the label file name is fully qual-
ified (begins with ./ or /), it will be used unchanged.   If
only a basename is specified, output_dir will be prepended.

Xspectrum now responds correctly to the xwaves do_color set-
ting.   When  black-and-white plots are requested by setting
do_color 0, the xspectrum window is rendered accordingly and
can  now  be  dumped  to a hardcopy printer/plotter.  Previ-
ously, some xwaves colormaps caused all-black xspectum hard-
copies.

Xspectrum had a display instability when two or  more  spec-
trum  displays  overlapped.  They could keep sending refresh
messages to one  another  and  alternately  perform  "raise"
operations   (forever!)   if   xspectrum_datwin_forward  was
enabled.  This has been fixed.

Xspectrum  occasionally  crashed  when  the  related  xwaves
display object was killed.  This has been fixed.

Xspectrum now permits computation of extremely  large  FFT's
(limited  only by the user's patience and hardware).  A soft
limit  is  still  implemented  via  the   xspectrum   global
max_fft_size,  which  defaults  to 65536, to protect against
accidents!  To change this, just send a command to xspectrum
like
              send set max_fft_size 1000000".

The xspectrum manual page had several errors regarding  max-
imum window sizes, and it has also been corrected.


5.  NOTES

Smooth operation of xwaves is dependent upon the  configura-
tion of your operating environment.  For an overview, please
refer to the document $ESPS_BASE/xview/README  (also  avail-
able  under  the  "Other Documents" item on the einfo menu).
In particular, you may need to put the  following  items  in
your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:

        *Foreground:                    black
        *Background:                    white
        window.color.foreground:        black
        window.color.background:        white
        4Dwm*positionIsFrame:           T
        4Dwm*positionOnScreen:          T
        4Dwm*interactivePlacement:      F
        4Dwm*clientAutoPlace:           false
        Mwm*interactivePlacement:       False
        Mwm*clientAutoPlace:            False
        XView.ICCCMCompliant:           False

This release of waves+ comes without a Sunview version.  The
old program waves+, (alias svwaves, waves, svwaves+, ...) no
longer exists.  Entropic no  longer  ships  or  maintains  a
Sunview-compatible  version  of  xwaves.   We  strongly urge
users of waves+ to try the new X version which  has  all  of
the  features you are familiar with, is very robust, and has
many new features never available under Sunview.

Wplay and wrecord have  been  eliminated.   They  have  been
replaced  by  a family of play and record programs with con-
siderably enhanced capabilities.  See "eman play" and  "eman
record".

All programs are now linked "static".  Although this results
in  larger  program  binaries,  it  should  greatly ease the
installation and maintenance problems for xwaves and related
programs.   Previously, it was necessary to either force the
use of the graphics libraries shipped from Entropic  through
use of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH UNIX environment variable, or run
the risk of having version skews in  the  dynamically-loaded
libraries.   These  complications have been eliminated.  All
references to Entropic directories can be removed  from  the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH definition (e.g. in .cshrc files).
