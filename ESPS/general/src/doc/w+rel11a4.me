Fixed a bug that could cause attachments to hang.

.np
The default labelmenu (/usr/esps/lib/waves/labelmenu) changed to use the
ASCII symbols used in the DARPA TIMIT continuous speech
database.
.np
Label man page updated.   The addition of a labelmenu that contains
the ASCII symbols used in the DARPA TIMIT continuous speech
database labeling has been documented.
.uh "Known Problems"
.lp
.np
\fIWaves\fP+ and its attachments sometimes look for files in ESPS/lib
instead of ESPS/lib/waves.  This is always harmless.  In specific
cases, you might want to put a copy of the relevant file into
ESPS/lib.  
.np
Play commands issued from the file browser menu are wired to \fIplay\fR
and are not affected by the global \fBplay_prog\fR.
.np
Default \fI.wave_pro\fR and \fIlabelmenu\fR are not picked up from
\fI/usr/esps/lib/waves\fR.  Copy the default \fI.wave_pro\fR to your
home directory and the default \fIlabelmenu\fR to your working
directory.
