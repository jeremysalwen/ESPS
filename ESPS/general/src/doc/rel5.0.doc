               ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes

               Document version: 1.8 9/10/93

1.  INTRODUCTION

This document provides notes for release 5.0 of ESPS.  These
release  notes  document  changes to ESPS since the revision
4.2.  This document can be viewed conveniently  using  einfo
(1-ESPS) or eversion (1-ESPS).

This document does not attempt to explain  new  and  changed
programs  in  detail.  Refer to the manual pages for all new
and changed programs for complete details needed to use  the
programs.

Extensive changes were made in the  previous  release  (ESPS
Version  4.2;  waves+ Version 3.1).  These changes were pri-
marily aimed at correcting errors and  numerous  operational
deficiencies  in  the  software.  Please refer to either the
printed copy of these earlier release notes, or see the  on-
line     version     in     $ESPS_BASE/doc/rel4.2.doc    and
$ESPS_BASE/doc/wrel3.1.doc.

2.  SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES

Major highlights include:

   + major improvements to the filter design  and  filtering
     programs

   + new analysis and synthesis programs

   + improved hardcopy output

   + updated documentation

3.  NEW PROGRAMS

3.1.  ANALYSIS/SYNTHESIS PROGRAMS

A new set of ESPS analysis/synthesis  programs  are  created
for  ESPS 5.0 release.  These programs allow maximum control
over analysis/synthesis parameters and  permit  experimenta-
tion with intermediate results. They are intended to replace
the older lpcana(1-ESPS) and lpcsynt(1-ESPS).  The following
is  a  list  of  new ESPS 5.0 speech analysis/synthesis pro-
grams:

epochs
     A pitch-epoch estimation  program.   Pitch  epochs  are
     computed  by dynamic programming optimization algorithm
     from speech residual.  Epochs also attempts to estimate










ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 2


     the  voicing state of speech residual.  Use its various
     parameters to control the estimation.

formsy
     This   is   n-formant   synthesizer.    Controls   over
     bandwidths, synthesis rate, F0 and formant characteris-
     tics are provided.

get_f0
     A faster F0 estimation  program  than  formant(1-ESPS).
     Unlike  formant,  get_f0  has  a simple interface - one
     FEA_SD input to produce one FEA file  output,  with  no
     intermediate  files  produced.   In addition, get_f0 is
     more flexible  in  controlling  F0  characteristics  by
     means  of  various  parameters.  Highpass filtering for
     input signal in formant is not automatically  performed
     in get_f0 to save computational time.

get_resid
     A program to compute speech residual by inverse filter-
     ing.   The  speech residual is required for pitch-epoch
     estimation program epochs(1-ESPS).  Use  refcof(1-ESPS)
     to  compute fixed-frame based LPC or reflection coeffi-
     cients before inverse filtering.

lp_syn
     This synthesizes speech signal  from  either  a  direct
     excitation  source  such  as speech residual, or from a
     parametric source such as F0, RMS data.  Controls  over
     parameter source, such as synthesis rate, are provided.

mask This is a useful program to suppress/fade segments of a
     FEA_SD  file  or  to mix segments of FEA_SD files.  For
     example, a FEA_SD file containing pitch epoch  impulses
     produced by epochs often misclassifies unvoiced regions
     as voiced, you can  use  mask  to  suppress  the  pitch
     epochs in unvoiced regions.

ps_ana
     This  computes   LP   parameters   pitch-synchronously.
     Analysis  frames  are  based on the pitch-epoch impulse
     files produced by epochs.  Output analysis results  are
     periodically  resampled.   Ps_ana also computes F0 tra-
     jectory pitch-synchronously.

syntdemo
     This is a demonstration shell  script  that  introduces
     the  new  ESPS  analysis/synthesis  programs  and  also
     serves as an general example of utilizing  xwaves,  the
     signal visualization tool, and XIG (X-interface Genera-
     tion), the X-Window user-interface customization facil-
     ity,  for  interactive  DSP  programming.  You can find
     this script in $ESPS_BASE/demo.

3.2.  NEW FILTER PROGRAMS

cb_filt
     desings a multiband FIR filter or a  differentiator  by
     constraint-based   algorithm   based   on   Meteor:   A
     constraint-based FIR filter design program,  Steiglitz,
     Parks,  and  Kaiser,  IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing,
     Vol 40, No.8, August, 1992.   This program  is  capable
     of designing a nearly flat filter on its passband.

pkmc_filt
     designs an equi-ripple FIR  filter  by  Parks-McClellan
     algorithm.   It  designs multiband filter, differentia-
     tor, and Hilbert transformer.

win_filt
     designs a multi-band FIR filter using Kaiser  windowing
     method.

xfir_filt
     This is a  shell  script  intended  as  an  example  of
     extending  ESPS  programs  with  XIG  user interface to
     build a customized filtering design  environment.   All
     ESPS FIR programs are used.

3.3.  OTHER NEW PROGRAMS

ebanner
     a cute program that converts ASCII text into   a   sam-
     pled   data   waveform  whose   wide-band   spectrogram
     image shows the ASCII text in  the  form   of   raster-
     graphics   fonts.   The  characters  are represented as
     a matrix of dots - some on and some off.  For each "on"
     dot,  a  wavelet  with  the  correct  location  in  the
     time-frequency  plane  is   generated.   All  of  these
     wavelets are then summed to produce the output.

meter
     this is a X-window based  front-end  program  for  ESPS
     recording  programs  to  control  and monitor recording
     process.

ps2frame
     this program is used  to  convert  embedded  PostScript
     files  produced  by the print graphic feature of xwaves
     and other programs to a form that can be imported  into
     IFrameMaker.    We believe that the embedded Postscript
     files produced by our programs is legal PostScript, but
     Frame  will not handle these files, because of the user
     of BoundingBox: (atend)  near  the  top  of  the  file.
     ps2frame replaces this with the real boundingbox infor-
     mation that is located near the end of the file.











ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 4


spec_subr
     this is a new program for selecting frequency subranges
     of  FEA_SPEC files.  The output is a FEA_SPEC file con-
     taining the subset  of  the  data  in  the  input  file
     corresponding  to a range of frequencies specified with
     a command-line option. The output frequency  format  is
     "ARB_FIXED"---frequencies  are listed explicitly in the
     header.  A command running the program can be added  to
     the xwaves menu to provide a frequency-zoom capability.

xspecav
     to be called from xwaves.  The new xspecav uses filter-
     ing  operation  to  do  spectral averaging.  The filter
     kernels can be one of the rectangular, hanning, hamming
     window-  designed  FIRs.   The delay introduced by non-
     causal filtering is offset  by  start_time  --  a  time
     value  corresponding to filter delay is subtracted from
     the original  start_time.   This  means  the  resulting
     spectral  slice to which the cursor points comes from a
     region of the original data windowed by one of the win-
     dows, with its center corresponding to the time cursor.

zst  a shell script which  sets  start  times  to  zero  and
     adjusts corresponding label files, has been added.

4.  CHANGES TO ESPS PROGRAMS

addfea
     there was a bug that caused core dumps on  some  archi-
     tectures  when the length of the comment added with the
     -c option was exactly 11.

atosps
     same fix as for fea_edit above.

btosps
     A bug was fixed that sometimes caused btosps to put  an
     incorrect  value  for  the header item max_value in its
     output file.

classify
     added parameter file processing and a default parameter
     file.

classify
     added warning  message  if  0  determinant  of  inverse
     covariance is found.

fbuttons
     added -s option to specify a  scrollable  list  in  the
     panel.












ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 5


fbuttons
     added -q option to allow suppression  of  quit  button;
     added  -Q option to allow arbitrary label for quit but-
     ton; added -l option to allow command for execution  on
     exit  via quit button; fixed some bugs in the placement
     geometry; and program buttons labels not  appear  above
     the buttons, to save space.

fbuttons
     -c and -h options were added.  If -c  is  specified,  a
     set  of exclusive panel choice buttons is used for each
     olwm submenu instead of a menu button with a  pull-down
     menu.  By default the choice buttons are laid out vert-
     ically.  If -h is used, they are laid out horizontally.

fea_edit
     fixed problem that fea_edit had with  files  containing
     CHAR generic header items.

feafunc
     an additional function exp10 (ten-to-the-power, inverse
     of log10) has been added.

feafunc
     minor changes were made to specify explicitly the value
     returned  by  convention by LOG for zero arg.  This was
     done for the benefit of the new function arr_op,  which
     uses the LOG case of arr_func in computing powers.

filter
     this program has been removed and replaced by  filter2,
     which  was  introduced  in  the  previous ESPS release.
     Filter has been removed (it is unstable) and  the  name
     filter is now linked to filter2.

find_ep
     bugs fixed: (1) the filename in the common file was not
     updated  if the -w option was in effect; (2) one of the
     debugging messages produced with the -x  option  showed
     garbage  for the output file name; (3) if the -n option
     was used with no filename in common, the program  would
     produce  a  core  dump,  rather  than an error message,
     before  exiting.    The   150   ms   lower   limit   on
     "silence_req",  the  argument  of  the -s option, is no
     longer enforced; it is just stated as a recommend lower
     limit  in  the  manual  entry.  A missing -b option was
     added to the Synopsis in the manual entry.

image
     a bug in the image program was fixed that  caused  core
     dumps  when  a debug level of 2 or higher was specified
     with the -x option.











ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 6


mbuttons
     If -c is specified, a set  of  exclusive  panel  choice
     buttons is used for each olwm submenu instead of a menu
     button with a pull-down menu.  By  default  the  choice
     buttons  are  laid out vertically.  If -h is used, they
     are laid out horizontally.

mbuttons
     added -Q option to allow arbitrary label for quit  but-
     ton;  added -l option to allow command for execution on
     exit via quit button.

mu2esps
     this program  can  now  handle  SUNOS  4.1  audio  file
     headers.

plot3d
     Two plot3d bugs were fixed:  moving the  box  with  the
     mouse  with  no  data  loaded  could cause a core dump;
     sometimes the 3d cursors were drawn in the wrong  rela-
     tion to the mouse position.   Major improvement is that
     hardcopy output of the plot is now possible, in  either
     PostScript  or  PCL.   A print setup panel is available
     for selecting output type, scaling, and output device.

plotfield
     A bug was fixed in the  plotfield  script  that  caused
     incorrect processing of command-line arguments when the
     text argument of the -t option contained blanks.

sfconvert
     changed the default value of sfwin_len in  the  default
     parameter  file  to  a  more  reasonable  value  of .01
     (seconds).

sgram
     reversed the sense of the -z option  so  that  warnings
     about zero power in frames are off by default.

splay
     a bug was fixed with caused the -a to  have  no  effect
     unless  the  -b option was used also.  And if -a and -b
     are both used, the -b option has no effect.

srecord
     modified to require an output file,  or  -  to  specify
     standard output.

tofspec
     The tofspec program can now produce FEA_SPEC  files  in
     "ARB_FIXED"  format---frequency  values  are not neces-
     sarily uniformly spaced and are given  by  an  explicit
     list  in  the header.  The frequencies may be specified










ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 7


     by a command-line option or a parameter-file entry.

vqasc
     memory leak fixed.

vqdesasc
     added -l option as was added to vqasc in  version  4.2.
     This  option  is  to  allow specification of input line
     length to override compiled in default.

wmse_filt
     a FIR design program by minimum mean square error  cri-
     teria,  no  longer  prompts user for design parameters.
     It now supports standard ESPS parameter  file  process-
     ing,  which  can  be  used  with  xeparam(1-ESPS),  and
     eparam(1-ESPS).

xfft xfft was changed to permit a -c option; a new parameter
     file  PWfftc  was  created  to  facilitate  taking fft-
     spectrograms of complex sampled data.

5.  NEW AND CHANGED LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

arr_func
     modified to handle additional function, exp10,  inverse
     of log10.  Use by feafunc program.

arr_op
     This a new library function for performing  element-by-
     element  arithmetic  operations on arrays of any of the
     ESPS numeric types.  The currently supported operations
     are  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication, division,
     forming a complex number from its  real  and  imaginary
     parts, and raising a given number to a given power.

exv_bbox
     exv_bbox was extended to support exclusive panel_choice
     buttons  for  submenus  instead  of  menu  buttons with
     pull-down menus.  There are two new items in the param-
     eter structure (typedef bbox_par):
       int button_choice;            /* if true, show submenus as panel choice
                                        items instead of button menus */
       int choice_horizontal;        /* if true, panel choice items are
                                        displayed horizontally */

exv_bbox
     added the following parameters for allowing the user to
     put  an  arbitrary label on the QUIT button and to exe-
     cute an arbitrary function when it is pressed
               char *quit_label;     /* if non-NULL, name for QUIT button */
               char *quit_data;      /* QUIT button data string */
               void (*quit_data_proc)(); /* execution function for QUIT data data */
     these changes are needed in order to support  analogous










ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 8


     changes to fbuttons and mbuttons

get_genhd_coded
     A bug was fixed in the library function get_genhd_coded
     for  items  with  more  than  one element, the returned
     value consisted of repetitions of the first element.

matinv
     a bug in the determinant functions, determ and determ_d
     was  fixed:  they would allocate memory and not free it
     before returning.  The  problem  was  apparent  in  the
     operation  of  the  classify  program, which would fail
     with a memory allocation failure after classifying some
     number  of records (a number depending on the number of
     classes and the number of features used for classifica-
     tion).

read_header
     a bug was fixed that could cause a program to fail when
     reading a FEA_SPEC file with frequency format ARB_FIXED
     by unnecessarily demanding the presence of a sf generic
     header  item.   read_header was also modified to handle
     version 1.7a of Sphere headers.

waves_show_sd
     this new library function allows  user  to  display  an
     array  of  data  by  a  simple call and have the result
     displayed in an xwaves window if xwaves is  running  in
     server mode.

6.  THE PUB DIRECTORY

The directory $ESPS_BASE/pub contains full-source copies  of
certain  relevant and useful public domain programs. You are
free to use them and pass them on in any  manner  consistent
with  restrictions  stated  by  their authors.  This release
contains these programs:

ghostscript
     This is a GNU implementation of PostScript.   It can be
     used to display PostScript files on the screen for cer-
     tain PostScript translations.  We have included  it  to
     make  the script ps2epsi available.  This script (which
     uses ghostscript will take the PostScript file from the
     new  print  option  on xwaves and plot3d and generate a
     new file including a preview image.  This allows a  low
     resolution  image of the PostScript file to be shown on
     the screen when the file is imported into programs such
     as FrameMaker.

tpipe
     This is a utility that splits a unix pipeline into  two
     pipelines.   Stated differently, the output of one pipe










ESPS Version 5.0 Release Notes                        page 9


     can provide the intput to two others.  tpipe was  writ-
     ten by David B. Rosen of Boston University.

xgrabsc
     A utility that allows you to grab arbitrary portions of
     the  screen and output them in Postscript or many other
     formats.  xgrabsc was written by Bruce Schuchardt.

tek2ps
     Written by Michael  Fischbein,  this  program  converts
     tektronix graphics codes into Postscript.  This is used
     by some of our plotting programs.

shellforms
     This is a utility to build  and  edit  forms.   It  was
     written by Paul Lew.

ghostscript
     This is a GNU  implementation  of  PostScript.   It  is
     included  here  because  it  includes a script that can
     process a PostScript file as output by  the  new  print
     graphics  feature  of ESPS and xwaves and add a preview
     image.  This script is ps2epsi.   The  particular  ver-
     sion of this script in our bin directory has been modi-
     fied to refer the the ghostscript library  in  our  pub
     directory.    If you desire to use the general features
     of ghostscript, you will have to install  it  from  the
     source.
