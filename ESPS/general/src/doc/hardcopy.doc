1.  Hardcopy from Vector Plot Programs

     The ESPS plot programs have a -T option for  specifying
the type of the output device.   The option "-T hardcopy" is
used to to get the default  (for  a  site)  hardcopy.    The
default  for the plotting programs is postscript send to the
spooler program "lpr".   If this is correct for your instal-
lation, then you do not have to do anything else.

     The vector plot programs, aplot, genplot, mlplot, plot-
field, plotsd, plotspec, and scatplot can plot to a hardcopy
devices that  are  compatible  with  Tektronix  plot  codes,
Postscript,  or  HP Laser Jet printers.    If the option "-T
hardcopy" is used with these programs, Tektronix  compatible
plot  codes  are  sent to a program called esps_plot (in our
bin directory).  This  program  takes  Tektronix  codes  and
sends them to a plotter.   By default, this script is set up
to convert the plot to Postscript and spool it to  lpr.   So
if  you have a Postscript printer setup so that you spool to
it with lpr, then "-T hardcopy" should work  right  off  for
you.

     If you have an HP Laser Jet  compatible  printer,  then
use  the  "-T  hp"  option with these programs.  This option
does not spool to the printer, so you must pipe  the  output
to  your  spooler.   For  example:  plotsd  -Thp  file.sd  |
print_hp (if print_hp is your HP printer spooler program).

     If you have some other type of device, and you know how
to  make  it  plot  Tektronix compatible codes, then you can
edit $ESPS_BASE/bin/esps_plot to make it handle your device.

2.  Hardcopy from Raster Plot Programs

     The program for printing spectrograms, plotsgram has  a
"-T  hardcopy"  option.  By default this sends Postscript to
the spooler lpr.   To change this  default,  edit  the  file
$ESPS_BASE/bin/plotsgram.   You  can make the default one of
Postscript, hp laser jet, or Imagen.    You can also specify
the  name  of  the  spooler program.  It is currently set to
lpr.   Search for SPOOL_CMD in the file.
