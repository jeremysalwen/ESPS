.sh 1 "About this tape"
In addition to an update of the Waves+ Standalone product, this tape
includes a \fIbeta\fR directory that contains a newer version of
\fIformant\fR.   This version has the changes that John Shore discussed
with Ray Watrous.   Copy this into the \fIesps/bin\fR directory.  There
is also a manual page in the \fIbeta\fR directory.
