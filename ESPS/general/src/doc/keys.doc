       1 .  Introduction

            Instead of requiring that a given software license be  associated
       permanently  with a given CPU, Entropic uses a floating license system
       that can assign software licenses dynamically as needed to any host on
       a  network.   This  document describes how this system works, provides
       guidelines for setting it up, and provides information to  help  solve
       common problems.

       1 .1 .  Goal of the License Manager System

            The license manager system is a technical means  of  implementing
       our  software  licensing  policy.    Our  current policy is to license
       waves+ on a per-user basis and ESPS on a per-host basis.   In the case
       of  waves+  the  license  manager will allow no more than the licensed
       number of waves+ to be running at any  one  time  on  the  network.  A
       waves+  license  is  checked out automatically when waves+ is run, and
       checked back in when waves+  terminates.   In  the  case  of  ESPS,  a
       license  must  be  checked out for a particular host before anyone can
       run ESPS programs on that host.  Until the license is checked back in,
       any  ESPS  programs  can  be  run on that host by any user (given that
       ordinary Unix file permissions are appropriate).  The ESPS license  is
       checked  out  for  a  host  in  one of two ways.  It can be explicitly
       checked out by the user by using the command echeckout, or  simply  by
       running an ESPS program.   If an ESPS program is run, and the required
       license is not checked out on the host, then the program will  attempt
       to  check  it out.  If that succeeds, then a license is checked out on
       that host until it is freed by the user.

            Our reasoning for the distinction between the  (per-user)  waves+
       licensing  and  the  (per-host)  ESPS licensing is as follows:  Unlike
       waves+, the typical ESPS program only runs for a short time period and
       does  not  provide  an  environment  in  which the user remains for an
       extended period.  Most ESPS programs are command line oriented and can
       be used in Unix shell scripts.  Therefore, if we had each ESPS program
       check out and free a license (as waves+ does) it would be possible for
       scripts  to  fail in unpredictable ways, since a license might a taken
       away between steps within the script.   Our solution  to  this  is  to










       ETM-S-91-xx:rap                                                 page 2


       have  a  program  which  checks out a license and one to free license.
       During the time that a license is checked out for a  given  host,  any
       ESPS  programs can be run on that host.    It does not matter how many
       users there are on that host or how many of those  users  are  running
       ESPS programs.

            The Entropic License Manager System  consists  of  the  following
       major components: elmd, elmadmin, echeckout, the license keys, and the
       various ESPS user programs.

       1 .2 .  How It Works

            The license manager daemon (elmd) is started and left running for
       as  long  as  any  Entropic programs are going to run.  It is normally
       started at boot time and simply left running forever.   When a  client
       program  requests  a license, the license manager checks the key files
       and determines if any licenses of the requested type remain.   If  so,
       then the count of available licenses is decremented and the requesting
       process is granted permission to continue.

            Client programs communicate with the  license  manager  with  the
       same  facility  used  by  the network file system (NFS), so any system
       that supports NFS should be able to run our license manager system.

            The client programs can be on a different host than the one  run-
       ning  the license manager daemon (elmd).  But in this case, the client
       programs must know which host is running elmd.   This  information  is
       passed  to  the  client  programs  via  the  Unix environment variable
       ELM_HOST.   It is simply set to the name of the network  host  running
       elmd.

            As mentioned earlier, waves+ checks out a license each time it is
       started  and  frees  that  license when it exits.   ESPS programs (all
       other programs except waves+ and its attachments) check to see  if  an
       ESPS license is checked out before they run, but they do not check out
       the license themselves.   The program echeckout  checks  out  an  ESPS
       license  and  then  holds  it (by putting itself into the background).
       The license is freed by causing echeckout to exit.   A program is pro-
       vided  to  do  this; efree.  Under certain conditions this program can
       fail to find echeckout.  In this case, someone will have to  find  the
       echeckout with ps and kill it manually.

       1 .3 .  Network Timeout

            The client programs (that is all ESPS programs and  waves+)  will
       timeout  in a default 10 second interval if they cannot get a response
       from the license manager daemon.   This should be enough time for  all
       but  the busiest networks.  However, we have provided a means to allow
       users to adjust  this  timeout  interval.   The  environment  variable
       ELM_TIMEOUT can be set to the desired timeout interval (integer values
       only).   So, for example, to set the timeout interval to 15 seconds do
       setenv ELM_TIMEOUT 15.  (Or whatever works with your shell.)

       ETM-S-91-xx:rap                                                 page 3


       1 .4 .  Waves Related ESPS Programs

            There is a set of ESPS programs that provide  conversion  support
       and  are included with the waves+ product.  These programs will run if
       a network has a valid waves license installed.   No  license  need  be
       explicitly  checked  out for these programs.  There is no limit to how
       many hosts these programs can be used on.  These programs are: addfea,
       addfeahd, addgen, bhd, btosps, comment, fea_element, featosd, formant,
       hditem,  hdshrink, ils_esps, mu2esps, pplain,  psps,  sdtofea,  sgram,
       sigtosd, testsd, splay, and tofspec.

       1 .5 .  User Written Programs

            User written programs compiled and linked with the ESPS libraries
       will  be  under  the Entropic license manager system.   These programs
       will only run if an ESPS license is checked out.   Also, if a site has
       a  source  license  to  ESPS and recompiles any of the above mentioned
       waves+ related programs, then they revert to the ESPS  license  rules;
       that is they will only run if an ESPS license is checked out.

       2 .  License Manager Setup

            The product installation instructions give sufficient information
       for  the  general  installation  of all of the software, including the
       license manager system.   Before installing  the  software,  you  must
       decide  which  host  is to run the license daemon (elmd).   While this
       can be any host that is reachable on  your  network,  there  might  be
       local  considerations  that make one host better or worse than others.
       Often the central server machine (if there  is  one)  is  the  logical
       choice.  Note  that  the license manager need not run on the same host
       which stores the ESPS files.   A poor choice of a machine to run  elmd
       on  would  be a machine behind several network bridges, one that tends
       to be down often, or one that might be considered a  personal  machine
       by a particular user.

            Once you decide which host will run elmd, you need  to  get  keys
       made  for  that  host.    Note that the keys are bound to a particular
       host, so that once the keys are made, they and elmd cannot be moved to
       another host (for obvious reasons).  Of course, if you have legitimate
       reasons for moving elmd and the keys to another host, we will give you
       new keys.   To install the keys, you must first run the program elmad-
       min -c which generates a server code that you provide to us.  We  take
       this  server  code,  along with the information about what you bought,
       and generate a key.

            The best way to communicate the server code to us is via email or
       FAX.   It  is best if an actual Unix script listing of the elmadmin -c
       output is sent.  This greatly reduces the chance for errors in copying
       the  server  code.   Voice telephone can be used, but it is more error
       prone.

            After the keys are installed echeckout and waves+ should run  (if
       the  proper  keys  were installed).   When running on a different host


       Version 1.2                      ERL                           1/22/93







       ETM-S-91-xx:rap                                                 page 4


       than elmd is running on, then the environment variable  ELM_HOST  must
       be set to the hostname of the host running elmd.

       2 .1 .  ELMD Initialization

            The license manager daemon, elmd, will  not  issue  licenses  for
       about  three  minutes after it first starts up.   If you try and run a
       program during this interval, you will get  a  message  informing  you
       that  the  daemon  is  initializing and to try again in a few minutes.
       The reason for this is to allow an instance of the daemon to  resynch,
       in the event that it restarts while licenses are checked out.

       2 .2 .  A Word About the ESPS Program Files

            One advantage of this license manager  system  is  that  you  can
       store  the  ESPS  program files on as many machines on your network as
       you see fit, since the number of copies stored is independent  of  how
       many  copies  may  run.   A  reason to store the files is to avoid NFS
       latencies resulting from dragging large binaries across  the  network.
       This  is   tradeoff of performance and disk usage that must be made at
       each site.  Also, individual users can choose to store copies of  cer-
       tain programs locally.

       3 .  Trouble Shooting Chart for License Keys

       3 .1 .  Errors When Entering Keys:  (Messages from elmadmin -c)

            Key directory does XXXX does not exist.

            This means that the directory where the keys will be stored  does
       not exist.  This indicates a major problem with the ESPS installation.
       The directory is esps/lib/keys under the ESPS root.

            Key create error: XXXX is not a directory.

            The key could not be stored because the filename which should  be
       a  directory  for  holding  the  keys, is not a directory.  This would
       indicate a serious problem with the ESPS installation.

            Error generating server code

            This is usually caused by  network  related  problems.     Please
       check  to  see that the system has a hostname assigned to it.  Use the
       Unix command hostname.  If it prints out nothing,  then  consult  with
       your  system administrator.  In order to run elmd the system must have
       a hostname and network address.   If the system does have a  hostname,
       there must be an entry in the host table (usually /etc/hosts) for that
       hostname. Try and see if you can open a network  connection  to  your-
       self.   That  is  if  your  hostname  is fred, then see if telnet fred
       works.   If this fails, then your network is not properly configured.

            Error writing key



       Version 1.2                      ERL                           1/22/93







       ETM-S-91-xx:rap                                                 page 5


            The user running elmadmin -c does not have  write  permission  on
       the  key  directory.    The key should be installed by the same userid
       that owns the ESPS files (usually the user that read  in  the  product
       tape).

            Invalid Key

            This means that the key as entered is  incorrect.   Double  check
       the key.   Also double check the server code.

       4 .  Run-time Problems after Entering the Key

       4 .1 .  Problems with echeckout or waves:

            License manager on  server  hostname  initializing.   Please  try
       again in x minutes.

            When the license manager daemon first starts it  will  not  grant
       requests  for  about  three minutes.  This allows time for any clients
       that might be running to check in with the daemon in the event that it
       exited while client programs were running.

            Invalid hostname:  hostname.   Check  your  ELM_HOST  environment
       variable..

            The hostname specified by ELM_HOST  is not a  valid  hostname  on
       your network.

            Sorry, but there is no ESPS license checked  out  on  this  host.
       You  must  first  run  echeckout  to get a license for this host.  See
       echeckout(1-ESPS).

            You have tried to run a program which requires an ESPS license to
       be  checked  out  and  no  license  is checked out on this host.   Run
       echeckout first.

            Unable to find an Entropic license  server.   You  have  ELM_HOST
       defined  to  hostname.  Be sure that elmd is running on host hostname,
       or correct ELM_HOST.  Note: In this version of the software,  you  can
       leave  ELM_HOST  undefined and force the client programs to locate the
       server on your network.  In general, better performance is achieved by
       defining ELM_HOST, however.

            This means that the client could not  find  an  Entropic  license
       manager  daemon.   Could  be that it isn't running, or the environment
       variable ELM_HOST is incorrectly  defined.   You  can  leave  ELM_HOST
       undefined  to  force  the  client  to  find  the daemon, but we do not
       currently recommend that.

            Unable to find an Entropic license server.  Be sure elmd is  run-
       ning  on  the  host system for which the license keys were issued for.
       If you know the name of the host running elmd, then  try  setting  the
       environment variable ELM_HOST to that hostname.

            This is the message that you'll get if ELM_HOST is undefined  and
       the client program cannot find a license daemon on your network.

            Network or system error, code: xx.  Perhaps your network  is  not
       running.   Contact Entropic if you cannot resolve this.

            You'll get this message if your  network  is  working  correctly.
       It  will  also  be given for other various errors. A common problem is
       running out of socket connections (error code -8).  On Sun systems, we
       find that the maxusers kernel parameter should be set to 32 for a sys-
       tem running X windows, NFS, and applications like waves+.    A  server
       system  with multiple users or a number of NFS mounts should have this
       parameter even larger, say 64.   Note this  this  parameter  does  not
       really  control the number of users, but instead is used to size vari-
       ous kernel data structures.   The  Sun  documentation  says  that  you
       should  allow  1  for each real users, each window, and each NFS mount
       and client.   Remember to allow for possible network users and  remote
       X windows.  If you cannot resolve this, please call us for help.

            Sorry, no waves+ licenses currently are available.

            You have tried to run (x)waves+ and  no  licenses  are  currently
       available.   You can use elmadmin -l to see where they are being used.

            Sorry, but your license has expired.

            Your license has expired.  This would happen for a trial  system,
       or  some  kind of special deal.   If you didn't expect your license to
       expire, then call us.

            Sorry, but you do not seem to have a license for waves+.  Is  the
       key file installed and readable? The key file should be filename.

            The license system cannot find a key for the program you are try-
       ing  to  run.  Either you don't have a license, or something is wrong.
       If you think you should have a license, have you  installed  your  key
       from us?  The filename printed out by the error message is the path to
       the keyfile itself.   See if the modes on this file make  it  readable
       by anyone who might try and run the Entropic software. If the key file
       is there and readable, then it is possible that  you  were  given  the
       wrong  type  of keys (for example Sun3 keys on a Sun4).  Call Entropic
       for help if you cannot resolve this.

            Sorry, you do not have a license for this feature.   Please  con-
       tact Entropic if you think this is an error.

            You have tried to run a program requiring a special license  key.
       The  license  system cannot find the required key.  At this time, this
       message only comes from the programs  mbuttons  and  fbutons.    These
       programs should run if you have either an ESPS or waves+ license.

            License manager authorization failure,  possibly  the  daemon  is
       running on the wrong machine.

            This means that the license manager is running on a machine other
       than  that which the keys were made for, or the network address of the
       machine has changed since the keys were made.
