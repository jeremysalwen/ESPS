              waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes

               Document Version: 1.9 9/10/93

1.  INTRODUCTION

This document described changes to xwaves since version  3.1
(the version prior to 5.0).    For complete details refer to
the xwaves manual.

Extensive changes were made in the  previous  release  (ESPS
Version  4.2;  waves+ Version 3.1).  These changes were pri-
marily aimed at correcting errors and  numerous  operational
deficiencies  in  the  software.  Please refer to either the
printed copy of these earlier release notes, or see the  on-
line     version     in     $ESPS_BASE/doc/rel4.2.doc    and
$ESPS_BASE/doc/wrel3.1.doc.

Many of the new features described  below  are  made  easily
accessible  through  the  new  xwaves startup environment we
provide.  To be certain  that  you  obtain  this  handy  new
environment,  check that the global init_file is not defined
in your .wave_pro startup profile file.  If you do not  have
a  personal profile (in $HOME/.wave_pro), you will automati-
cally get the new environment.

2.  VERSION 5.0 RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS

3.  SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES

Version 5.0 of xwaves is compatible  with  scripts  and  use
patterns  established  for earlier versions.  Note, however,
that many new things are possible, and many of the old  res-
trictions  have been removed.  Even experienced users should
be sure to read the updated xwaves and  attachments  manuals
before designing new control scripts or user interfaces.  In
particular, study the new add_op  command  and  the  Symbols
section of the xwaves manual.

In most instances it is now  preferable  to  control  xwaves
directly  from  the  shell  (or shell scripts) by way of the
send_xwaves command-dispatching program.  In  previous  ver-
sions,  the utility of send_xwaves was limited by failure of
processes using it to synchronize properly with xwaves.  The
program  send_xwaves can now optionally block for ALL xwaves
commands, including sleep  and  pause.   This  permits  much
greater flexibility in the design of shell scripts that con-
trol xwaves running as a display  server.   Send_xwaves  can
send  commands to xwaves running on any host in the internet
namespace.  Send_xwaves now returns the result of xwaves get
commands  to  it's  standard output.  It also returns a non-
zero exit status on failure to  communicate  correctly  with
xwaves.

We now provide an xwaves test script.  In  addition  to  its
use  in  verifying  the  soundness  of your installation, it
includes numerous examples of new and old  xwaves  features.
As  you  read the new manual, refer to the UNIX shell script
in $ESPS_BASE/bin/test_waves.

3.1.  Fundamentally New Capabilities

3.1.1.  Graphics Output

Xwaves and its attachments now have the capability to export
their graphics (all plots) in either embedded PostScript for
PCL (HP LaserJet code).  This can be used  to  print  xwaves
displays directly on the printer, or to generate graphics to
be imported into a document with  a  suitable  text  editing
program.  A new menu item has been added to the default menu
on each xwaves data view:  print  graphic.   Selecting  this
item  causes  the view to be redrawn at full printer resolu-
tion using PostScript or PCL with the  results  going  to  a
file or to the printer of your choice.

3.1.2.  Multiple attachments

Xwaves may now have any number of attachments active  simul-
taneously,   including  multiple  invocations  of  the  same
attachment.  The attachment  and  send_xwaves  facility  has
been completely reimplemented using the standard unix remote
procedure calls (RPC).  Attachments can either be started by
xwaves, or run as programs in separate shells.

3.1.3.  Overlays

The signal-overlay  facility  has  been  fully  generalized.
Signals  can  be overlaid on one another regardless of their
respective data types  or  sampling  frequencies.   Multiple
overlays  in distinctive colors are supported.  Overlays may
be selectively removed from the view using the kill command.

3.1.4.  View Customization

Many operations formerly available only as global  operators
for  all  xwaves  displays  can  now be performed on a view-
specific and  view-element-specific  basis.   This  includes
setting or changing any of the view display attributes.  The
displays  are  now  updated  automatically  to  reflect  any
changed  made  in their attributes.  Previously, an explicit
refresh operation had to be performed.

3.1.5.  Ordinate Markers

Ordinate markers have been added to xwaves.  These  horizon-
tal  dashed lines may be used to delimit y-coordinate infor-
mation, select a channel index, or establish a  data  value,
depending  on  the context.  The markers appear in all views
and are moved synchronously when their meaning across  views
is  coherent.  The same basic paradigms are used to move the
horizontal and vertical markers with the mouse pointer.   To
select horizontal cursor movement, depress the shift key.











waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                      page 4


3.1.6.  Keyboard Mapping

We have implemented the mapping of xwaves operators to  key-
board  keys.   Any  built-in menu operator or operator added
with add_op may be bound to a  key.   There  are  three  new
xwaves   commands   for   managing  this  mapping:  key_map,
key_unmap and  save_keymaps.   See  the  xwaves  manual  for
details.

3.1.7.  Long-lines Editing

We have added a text widget to permit long-lines editing  in
xlabel.   The  editing  mode  is entered by left mousing the
item to be changed  with  the  CTRL  key  depressed,  or  by
selecting  the  *EDIT*  item  in the xlabel menu. This quick
editor uses  exactly  the  same  application  rules  as  the
REPLACE  mode.  (It is sensitive to the active items and the
starred active item; it applies  to  the  label  closest  in
time, etc.)

3.1.8.  Cepstral Smoothing

Cepstral smoothing has been added to the FFT-based  spectrum
estimation  methods.   The  original code modifications pro-
vided by the MIT-LCS group have  been  expanded  to  include
control  over  the  lifter transition region.  Thus, one can
choose highpass or lowpass; the nominal cutoff qufrency; and
the qufrency transition duration.

3.1.9.  Zooming in Xspectrum

Zooming to markers  in  amplitude  and  frequency  has  been
implemented  in xspectrum.  By default, if a non-null region
is delimited with the horizontal  and/or  vertical  markers,
zooming  takes place immediately to that region.  The right-
button menu permits enabling/disabling this feature. Markers
are  moved  using  the  up/down  move paradigm with the left
mouse button.  Horizontal markers are moved with  the  shift
key  depressed.  Since the left mouse button in xspectrum is
now used to move  the  frequency/amplitude  cursors,  it  no
longer automatically saves the current spectrum as an under-
lay reference.  This can,  however,  still  be  accomplished
using the right mouse-button menu.


3.2.  Extensibility Features

3.2.1.  Custom Operators

A generalized mechanism for adding xwaves commands that pro-
vides  external  processes  with  complete  access to xwaves
internal state was added.  The command  that  accesses  this
capability  is  called add_op.  It subsumes the functions of










waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                      page 5


add_espsf, add_espst, add_waves, and  add_espsn.   All  unix
processes are now accessible via add_op, regardless of their
command-line syntax or semantics.  All internal xwaves func-
tions  may  also be used in add_op commands, including other
add_op commands.  All operators  defined  using  add_op  may
access  xwaves'  internal  state  and  the state of any view
using symbolic reference.  Output  file  specifications  can
appear  anywhere on the command line and can include, in one
command, data destined for  text,  waveform  or  spectrogram
displays, as well as viewless output files.  Add_esps{f,n,t}
are now considered obsolescent. However, they are still emu-
lated using the new add_op command..

3.2.2.  Access to Time Marks

Xwaves has always had commands to apply permanent  marks  to
the  displays (the mark command).  These marks were formerly
used primarily by the attachments, like xlabel  and  xmarks,
to  indicate segment boundaries.  We now provide generalized
access to these through symbols.  This permits the  develop-
ment  of  very useful segment operators with the add_op com-
mand.  It provides a means for very rapid random access  for
comparison of segments in a given signal.

3.2.3.  User-defined Symbols

Xwaves now supports the  definition  of  arbitrary  symbols,
much  like  the  UNIX  environment variable facility.  These
definitions are accessed through exactly the same mechanisms
used  for  managing  built-in globals (profile file; set and
get commands; symbolic reference in add_op commands).

3.2.4.  Arbitrary Button Bindings

The Button Modes menu selection has been extended to include
all active menu items.  Buttons may now be bound to any menu
item and any operation defined with the add_op command on  a
view-specific  basis.   Thus,  each data view in an ensemble
can have its own button semantics individually defined.

3.2.5.  External Access to Menus

All xwaves  menu-driven  operations  and  other  operations,
including  those created with add_op, may now be accessed by
xwaves-external processes using the new command, op.  Op may
be sent to any display ensemble.  It can be used to simulate
any mouse or keyboard operation in any view.

3.2.6.  Symbolic Access

The xwaves get command has been expanded  to  access  essen-
tially  all  of  xwaves'  internal state.  This includes the
so-called global items, as well as attributes of all current










waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                      page 6


views,  and  lists of such things as current operators, com-
mands and  files.   These  are  the  items  also  accessible
through symbolic references in add_op commands.

3.2.7.  Custom Blow-up Function

We added blowup_op as a global settable to permit specifica-
tion  of the operation to be performed when a button defined
as blow_up;function is released.  This can be any  operation
added  with  add_op,  or  any  built-in  menu operation.  By
default, xspectrum, xlabel and xmarks all add themselves  as
the blowup_op as part of their initialization to emulate the
behavior of older xwaves versions.

3.2.8.  Commands to Attachments

Since multiple attachments are now possible, the xwaves send
command has been augmented to permit messages to be directed
to a particular  attachment.   If  only  one  attachment  is
active,  the  older  form  of  the  send  command behaves as
before, so that existing xwaves  scripts  will  continue  to
work correctly.

3.2.9.  Remote Xlabel Access

There is now a label qualifier to the mark command  in  xla-
bel.   This  permits  full  specification of the label to be
applied via a send command.  Now, any external  process  can
apply  labels  of  any content to the xlabel data view (e.g.
via the send_xwaves program or library calls).

3.2.10.  New Source Example

A new example attachment has been provided in  source  form.
xample.c is an RPC-based attachment for xwaves that does not
use xview.  This can serve as a skeleton for developing your
own,   custom  attachments.   This  file  can  be  found  in
$ESPS_BASE/lib.

3.2.11.  Custom Spectrum Estimation

The new features in xwaves and xspectrum permit  implementa-
tion  of  specialized  spectrum  estimation  techniques  and
display of the results in the xspectrum display window.   An
example script demonstrating this feature is provided in the
xspectrum manual.


3.3.  Ease of Use Features














waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                      page 7


3.3.1.  Graphics Export Control

There is a new xwaves command:  print_setup.   This  command
invokes a setup window that allows the user to select output
to a file or printer; name an output file; specify a command
for  the  local  or  networked printer; choose PostScript or
PCL; set the resolution of output device;  specify  a  scale
factor; and choose PostScript Level 1 or 2.  This command is
most easily invoked by the button  print  setup  on  in  the
xwaves  startup  environment panel.  All of these parameters
may also be set remotely by send_xwaves or an xwaves script.

3.3.2.  Customizing Xwaves

We provide a graphical interface to the new add_op  command-
definition  facility  through the add_op_panel command.  The
xwaves default startup environment that we now provide gives
you  quick  access  to the add_op_panel with a single button
press.  Add_op_panel not only helps you build custom  opera-
tors,  it  also  provides  quick  reference access to xwaves
variables, commands and keywords.

3.3.3.  Help with Symbols

We have implemented informational access to  argument  lists
for  xwaves commands.  If any command is issued with a ques-
tion mark (?) as the first non-white character in the  argu-
ment  list,  xwaves returns the names of all acceptable key-
words for the given command.  Thus the shell command

        send_xwaves set ?

will return the names of all xwaves globals.

3.3.4.  Output File Management

All displayable files created with add_op  operators,  spec-
trogram  commands,  etc. now appear in the new files browser
list accessible by right mousing the  OUTPUT  file  control-
panel  item.   This  list  may  also be accessed via the new
xwaves symbol new_files.  Thus, to remove all files  created
during a given run of xwaves, you could issue the shell com-
mand:

        rm -f `send_xwaves get aname new_files`

Of course, this would remove ALL new files, including  those
saved  with save segment in file!  A safer strategy might be
to just save the list for perusal later:

        send_xwaves get aname new_files > misc_files_list












waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                      page 8


3.3.5.  Initializing Attachments

The attachments can now be fully customized through  entries
in your startup profile file (.wave_pro) or interactively by
sending set commands to the attachments.  See the attachment
manuals for listings of the relevant symbol names.

3.3.6.  Saving Attachment Customizations

All attachment-specific globals may now be  saved  with  the
new  save_globals command that has been added to the attach-
ments.  This saves the values in a form suitable for  inclu-
sion  in  your  xwaves  startup  profile (.wave_pro), so the
current configurations may be easily saved for  future  use.
This is especially handy for xspectrum, since it has so many
free parameters.

3.3.7.  Speedups for Xlabel

There are now keyboard qualifiers for the MOVE  and  REPLACE
modes  of  xlabel.   If  SHIFT is depressed, xlabel switches
into the MOVE mode (for middle button  operations)  as  long
SHIFT  is  held.  If SHIFT is depressed, the REPLACE mode is
in effect for label menu selections (but not for direct key-
board  entry).   The  previous  mode  is reentered after the
SHIFT key is released.

3.3.8.  Et Cetera

More state information is  shown  in  the  data-view  frame,
including mouse button bindings and full path names.

For brevity, and simplicity, the keyword op  has  been  made
synonymous  with  command  in  all  xwaves commands that use
these keywords.

We have resolved all differences in  xwaves'  processing  of
multi-word  text  arguments  (e.g.  for  op or command argu-
ments).  These may now be either quoted strings or not.   If
a  multi-word  argument  is the last item on a line, it need
not be quoted, but can be quoted  if  it  is  to  appear  in
another  position.  Formerly, items such as the middle_op or
left_op button specification were required to  be  the  last
item on a line.

We added the append_extensions  boolean  global  to  xwaves.
With  a  zero  value,  this  can switch off the appending of
extensions in the save segment in  file  function  (and  the
save  command).  This allows you to know exactly what output
filename will be used so that references can be made  later,
for example, in a shell script.

3.4.  General Enhancements

3.4.1.  Saving Xwaves Configurations

All operator definitions and menu items  created  using  the
add_op  command  may now be saved for later use with the new
save_add_ops and save_menus commands.  Thus, it is  possible
to  incrementally tailor xwaves to your exact needs.  Opera-
tors added with add_esps{f,t,n} are automatically  converted
to   equivalent   add_op   commands   when  saved  with  the
save_add_ops command.  The operator and menu definitions are
saved in the form of xwaves commands that may be executed to
reconstruct them.

3.4.2.  Reticles

Reticles with time scale and  ordinal  numbering  have  been
added  to all waveform views.  These reticles may be enabled
or disabled on a per-vector-element (per-channel)  basis  in
vector-signal (multi-channel) views.

3.4.3.  Improved Custom Control Panels

In xwaves 2.1 we introduced the make_panel command that pro-
vides  a simple means for developing your own custom control
interfaces.  In version 5.0 we have added  new  input  modes
and   better  state  feedback  to  the  panels  produced  by
make_panel.  We have also added the save_panels  command  to
save  the  current xwaves button panel configuration.  Thus,
you can develop new panels interactively,  and  when  satis-
fied, save the exact configuration for later use.

3.4.4.  New Line Types

Two new line types have been added to waveform plots; Type 3
is the DSP style, where a single vertical line is drawn from
the data value to the zero baseline  for  each  data  point.
Type 4 is the same, except hat the data points are also con-
nected with straight-line segments.  The line type  used  is
established  by the line_type global or view-specific attri-
bute.

3.4.5.  Access to Attachments

The attachments may now be started by a button press on  the
main  xwaves  Control  Panel.   The  attachment options that
appear are determined by the new symbol attachments that may
be defined in your .wave_pro profile file.  For example, the
entry

        attachments xspectrum xlabel xchart

would provide three options for selection.  Note that  these










waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                     page 10


are no longer mutually-exclusive. Several attachments can be
active at once.  If attachments is set to the  distinguished
value none, no attachment options will appear in the panel.

3.4.6.  Spectra of Long Sequences

Xspectrum can now perform spectrum estimation  on  sequences
of any length.  There is a soft limit on the size of the FFT
set by the  variable  xspectrum_max_fft_size  of  2  million
points.   This  can  be  changed by an entry in your startup
profile file (.wave_pro).

3.4.7.  Output from Xspectrum

Spectra created by xspectrum may now be saved  in  an  ASCII
file.   The  xspectrum control parameters, the source signal
file name,  and  the  spectrum,  as  frequency-log-magnitude
tuples, are saved to a named

3.4.8.  Et Cetera

The xwaves options keyword is now considered obsolete.   The
functional  bits  of this global have been expanded into the
more easily understood  global  booleans:  dont_save_sgrams,
redraw_on_release, rewrite_after_edit and overlay_as_number.
These attributes are  now  settable  on  a  per-view  basis.
Options is still recognized, but its use is discouraged.  It
will be removed in later xwaves versions.

The xwaves save and spectrogram commands now permit specifi-
cation  of  the output file name.  This makes it much easier
for external processes to keep track of the names  of  files
created by these operations.

Cross-view frequency  cursor  tracking  has  been  added  to
xspectrum.   Moving  the  cursor in the spectrum window will
cause the spectrogram cursors in  xwaves  to  track.   ASCII
file with the new save_spectrum command.


3.5.  Major Bug Fixes

The display repaint procedures have  been  made  more  effi-
cient.   Most  of  the  annoying  tendencies  for  xview  to
unnecessarily refresh the screen have been eliminated.

Due to a complete change in the xwaves to  attachments  com-
munications, screen lockup is no longer possible.















waves+ Version 5.0 Release Notes                     page 11


4.  KNOWN PROBLEMS

When xwaves starts, it attempts to register itself as an RPC
server  using  a  default  program  and version number.   If
another application happens to be using these same  numbers,
then  the registration will fail and xwaves will not be able
to act as an RPC server.  In this event, communications with
its  attachments  will fail.   This is very unlikely, except
in the case where another xwaves is  already  running  on  a
given  CPU  when xwaves is started.   If this does happen, a
message is printed on xwaves startup.     If  this  happens,
the  user should exit xwaves and start it again using the -V
option to specify some alternate version number.   In  prac-
tice  almost  any value will work.   If no message is issued
complaining that xwaves could not register as an RPC server,
then  the  new  value  is  OK.   This  problem will be fixed
shortly by having xwaves try alternate RPC addresses if  the
default fails.
