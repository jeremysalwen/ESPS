README for gpstohp   2/2/90

This is a hacked up gpstohp laserjet filter made from parts of
Entropic's mcd and image.    To compile just say "emake" in this
directory.   To test, do:

gpstohp <a.gps >a.hp

Then send a.hp to your HP laserjet.  You should get a box with little
boxes in the corners and the words "MCD OK" in the middle.


To use with the ESPS plot programs  use the -Tgps option and then pipe
the plot program through gpstohp to the printer.  For example:


plotsd -Tgps foo.sd | gpstohp > foo.hp


foo.hp contains a bitmap file ready to print on the HP.
