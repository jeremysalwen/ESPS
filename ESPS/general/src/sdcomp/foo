<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     sdcomp - listening program to compare two sampled data files


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>sdcomp</STRONG> [ <STRONG>-b</STRONG> <EM>shift</EM>-<EM>value</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-c</STRONG> <EM>channel</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>delay</EM> ]  [   <STRONG>-</STRONG>
     <STRONG>{fprs}</STRONG> <EM>range</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <EM>gain</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-i</STRONG> ] [ <STRONG>-R</STRONG> <EM>nrepeat</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-n</STRONG> <EM>step</EM> ]
     [ <STRONG>-w</STRONG> <EM>width</EM> ] [ <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>debug</EM>-<EM>level</EM> ] <EM>sdfile</EM> [ <EM>sdfile</EM> ... ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Sdcomp</EM> cycles through one or more ESPS <STRONG><A HREF="../man5.html/FEA_SD.5.html">FEA_SD(5-ESPS)</A></STRONG>  files
     playing  a  portion  from  each  file  by means of the local
     <STRONG><A HREF="../man1.html/play.1.html">play(1-ESPS)</A></STRONG> program.  <EM>Sdcomp</EM> assumes that  the  local  play
     program has the same command line options as <EM>mcplay</EM>.

     After <EM>sdcomp</EM> starts and after a portion is played from  each
     file, the user is prompted for the next action.  The follow-
     ing commands are then accepted (&lt;CR&gt; refers to the  "return"
     key):

          &lt;CR&gt;      play next portion from each file
          r&lt;CR&gt;          repeat current portion from each file
          b&lt;CR&gt;          back up and play previous portion from each file
          c&lt;CR&gt;          continue playing portions without stopping for commands
          q&lt;CR&gt;          quit



</PRE>
<H2>ESPS PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The ESPS parameter file processing is the same as  that  for
     <EM>mcplay</EM>.


</PRE>
<H2>ESPS HEADERS</H2><PRE>
     ESPS headers are treated as in <EM>mcplay</EM>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The flags <STRONG>bcgirwx</STRONG> are passed to the local play program every
     time  that  program  is invoked.  In addition, the following
     options are supported:

     <STRONG>-{prsf}</STRONG> <EM>range</EM>
          Selects the first portion that will be played from each
          file,  with  syntax as in <EM>mcplay</EM>. The default is <STRONG>-s</STRONG>0:1.
          If the part of the range specification after the  colon
          is  omitted  (giving  only  the  starting  point),  the
          defaults are as follows:

               <STRONG>-p</STRONG>&lt;start&gt;:+7999
               <STRONG>-r</STRONG>&lt;start&gt;:+7999
               <STRONG>-s</STRONG>&lt;start&gt;:+1
               <STRONG>-f</STRONG>&lt;start&gt;:+79

          These give approximately the  same  length  (1  second)
          when  the  sampling  frequency  is  8000  Hz.,  but not
          otherwise.

          The effect of the <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>{psrf}</STRONG>  option  is  to  select  the
          starting  position  and  length  of  the portion.  This
          length remains in effect for subsequent  portions  that
          are  played, while the starting positions of subsequent
          portions are determined by the <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option.  Note that <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
          and <STRONG>-r</STRONG> are synonyms.

     <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>delay</EM>
          If <STRONG>-d</STRONG> is not specified, <EM>sdcomp</EM> passes all the  filename
          arguments  to  one  invocation of the play program each
          time a portion is played from the files.   If   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>d</STRONG>  is
          specified,  then  each filename is passed to a separate
          invocation of the play program, which is followed by  a
          pause  of  <EM>delay</EM> seconds.  (Note that specifying <STRONG>-d0</STRONG> is
          not equivalent to omitting the option entirely.)

     <STRONG>-w</STRONG> <EM>width</EM> [100]
          This option defines  the  frame  width.  The  width  is
          ignored unless the <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option is also specified.

     <STRONG>-n</STRONG> <EM>step</EM>
          Selects the amount by which the  starting  position  is
          changed  from one portion of each file to the next por-
          tion of each file.  If the <EM>step</EM> is less than  the  por-
          tion length (determined by <STRONG>-{prsf}</STRONG> ), the portions will
          overlap.  If it is greater than the portion length, the
          portions  played  will skip segments of the files.  The
          <EM>step</EM> must be expressed in the same units as the  <EM>range</EM>.
          That  is, if <EM>range</EM> is specified with <STRONG>-p</STRONG> or <STRONG>-r</STRONG> (points),
          the <EM>step</EM> is assumed to be points, etc.  The default for
          <EM>step</EM> equals the length of the initial portion specified
          by the <STRONG>-{prsf}</STRONG> option.




</PRE>
<H2>FUTURE CHANGES</H2><PRE>
     The user should be able to change the order in  which  files
     are played.

     There should be an option that causes <EM>sdcomp</EM> to  select  the
     order  in which files are played and report that order after
     all of the speech has been played.

     The user should be able  to  change  the  position,  portion
     length, and step size dynamically.

     The user should be able to specify a separate gain (<STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>g</STRONG>)  or
     shift-value (<STRONG>-b</STRONG>) for each input file.

<H2>WARNINGS</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     <EM>A</EM> <EM>range</EM> or <EM>step</EM> value in seconds is  restricted  to  integer
     values (this reflects a bug in <EM>play</EM> ).
