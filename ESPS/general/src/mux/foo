</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <EM>mux</EM> (``multiplex'') program combines its input  sampled-
     data <STRONG><A HREF="../man5.html/FEA_SD.5.html">FEA_SD(5-ESPS)</A></STRONG> files, or equal-length portions of them,
     into a single multichannel output sampled-data file,  possi-
     bly  also  combining  real channels in pairs to form complex
     channels.

     Normally the number of output channels is the  total  number
     of channels in all the input files.  Each output record con-
     tains the data from the <EM>samples</EM> field in one record of  each
     input file.  This is organized as a single vector containing
     one sample value from  each  channel  of  each  input  file.
     Within  the vector, the data from the first input file comes
     first, followed by the data from the second, and so  on,  in
     the  order of the file names on the command line.  The chan-
     nels of any one input file keep the same  relative  ordering
     in the output file that they had in the input file.

     When the <STRONG>-J</STRONG> option is used, the number of output channels is
     only  half  the normal number; input channels of a real data
     type are combined in pairs into single  output  channels  of
     the corresponding complex type.

     The input files must be consistent in data type and sampling
     frequency; the output file has the same data type (unless <STRONG>-J</STRONG>
     is used) and the same sampling frequency as the input files.
     Any fields other than <EM>samples</EM> in the input are ignored.

     By default, the first output record contains data  from  the
     first record in each input file, and in general the <EM>n</EM>th out-
     put record contains data from the <EM>n</EM>th record in  each  input
     file;  but  a later starting point in each input file can be
     chosen with the <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option.  By  default,  records
     are  processed  until  an input file runs out of data, but a
     shorter range of data can be chosen with <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG>.

     If ``-'' is written for an input file, the standard input is
     used.   At most one input file may be standard input.  Names
     of disk files, however, may be repeated  (duplicating  chan-
     nels).   Since different <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-s</STRONG> options may apply to
     each instance of a repeated input file name, it is  possible
     to  align and juxtapose different portions of a single input
     file.  If ``-'' is written for the output, the standard out-
     put is used.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options are supported:

     <STRONG>-p</STRONG> <EM>range</EM>
          For this program <STRONG>-p</STRONG> and <STRONG>-r</STRONG> are synonymous.  See <STRONG>-r</STRONG>  for
          the interpretation and the format of the argument.

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>last</EM>

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <EM>first</EM><STRONG>:+</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>
          Determines the range of points (records)  to  be  taken
          from  an  input  file.   In  the  first form, a pair of
          unsigned integers gives the numbers of  the  first  and
          last records of the range.  (Counting starts with 1 for
          the first record in the file.)  If <EM>first</EM> is omitted,  1
          is  used.   If  <EM>last</EM> is omitted, the last record in the
          file is used.  The second form  is  equivalent  to  the
          first with <EM>last</EM> = <EM>first</EM> + <EM>incr</EM> .

          This option and the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> and <STRONG>-s</STRONG> options may  be  repeated
          up  to  a maximum total number, for all three kinds, of
          the number of input files.  The first <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>,  or   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>s</STRONG>
          option  applies  to the first input file, the second to
          the second, and so on.  If there are fewer <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, and
          <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>s</STRONG>  options  than  input  files,  the last such option
          applies to all the remaining input files.  In  particu-
          lar,  if  there  is  only  one <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option, it
          applies to all the input files.

          If two options disagree as to the number of records  to
          be  processed, the smaller number applies.  In fact <EM>mux</EM>
          stops processing as soon as it  encounters  either  the
          end  of  a specified range or the actual end of file in
          any input file.  Certain inconsistencies in these vari-
          ous  stopping criteria will evoke warning messages; see
          the Diagnostics section for details.

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG> <EM>start</EM><STRONG>:</STRONG><EM>end</EM>

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG> <EM>start</EM><STRONG>:+</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>
          Determines the range in seconds of the data to be taken
          from  an  input  file.   In  the  first form, a pair of
          floating-point numbers give the beginning time and end-
          ing  time  of the range.  The second form is equivalent
          to the first with <EM>last</EM> = <EM>first</EM> + <EM>incr</EM>. Each sample  has
          a  time  given  by <EM>s</EM> + (<EM>r</EM>-1)/<EM>f</EM>, where <EM>s</EM> is the value of
          the generic header item "start_time", <EM>r</EM> is  the  record
          number,  and  <EM>f</EM> is the sampling frequency, given by the
          generic  header  item  "record_freq".   This  time  may
          depend  on  the  channel number, since the "start_time"
          item may be a vector with a component per channel;  for
          present  purposes  the  value  for  the  first  channel
          (number 0) is used.  The range  selected  by  the   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>s</STRONG>
          option  consists  of  the records for which the time is
          less than <EM>end</EM> but not less than <EM>start</EM>.

          This option and the <STRONG>-p</STRONG> and <STRONG>-r</STRONG> options may  be  repeated
          to  supply  different ranges for different input files.
          See the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option for details.

     <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>debug</EM>_<EM>level</EM>
          If <EM>debug</EM>_<EM>level</EM> is positive, the program  prints  debug-
          ging messages as it progresses---the higher the number,
          the more messages.  The default  level  is  0,  for  no
          debugging output.

     <STRONG>-J</STRONG>    Join pairs of input channels to  form  single  complex
          output  channels.   The total number of channels in the
          input files must be even, and the output file has  half
          that  number of channels.  The input channels are taken
          in the usual order and grouped in  pairs  to  form  the
          real  and  imaginary parts of the output channels.  The
          pairing is without regard to whether two input channels
          come  from  the  same  input file or consecutive files.
          The last channel of a file, if not paired with the pre-
          vious  input  channel, is paired with the first channel
          of the next input file.

          The input files must all have the same real data  type:
          DOUBLE,  FLOAT, LONG, SHORT, or BYTE.  (See <STRONG><A HREF="../man5.html/FEA.5.html">FEA(5-ESPS)</A></STRONG>
          for an explanation of these type  codes.)   The  output
          file   has   the   corresponding   complex  data  type:
          DOUBLE_CPLX,  FLOAT_CPLX,  LONG_CPLX,  SHORT_CPLX,   or
          BYTE_CPLX.

          If two channels with with different time alignments are
          combined   into  one  complex  channel,  time-alignment
          information may be lost.  A warning message is  printed
          in  that  case.  See the discussion of the "start_time"
          generic header item in the section on ESPS Headers.

     <STRONG>-P</STRONG> <EM>param</EM>_<EM>file</EM>
          The name of the parameter file.  The  default  name  is
          ``params''.


</PRE>
<H2>ESPS PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
     The parameter file is not required to be present,  as  there
     are  default values for all parameters.  If the file exists,
     the following parameters may be read if they are not  deter-
     mined by command-line options.

     <EM>start</EM> - <EM>integer</EM> <EM>array</EM>
          The starting record number in  each  input  file.   The
          array  elements  are matched with input files in order.
          If there are more input files, the last  array  element
          applies to the unmatched file.  If there are more array
          elements, the unmatched ones are ignored.  This parame-
          ter  is  not read if the <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option is speci-
          fied.  The default is all 1's, meaning the beginning of
          each input file.

     <EM>nan</EM> - <EM>integer</EM>
          The number of records to process in each input file.  A
          value  of  0  (the  default)  means continue processing
          until the end of an input file is reached.  This param-
          eter  is not read if the <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option is speci-
          fied.

     <EM>make</EM>_<EM>complex</EM> - <EM>string</EM>
          A value of "YES" or "yes"  means  join  pairs  of  real
          channels  to  form complex channels as if the <STRONG>-J</STRONG> option
          is in force.  A value of "NO"  or  "no"  means  make  a
          separate  output  channel  for  each  input  channel as
          usual.  No other values are allowed.  This parameter is
          not  read  if  the <STRONG>-J</STRONG> option is specified.  The default
          value is "NO".


</PRE>
<H2>ESPS COMMON</H2><PRE>
     The ESPS Common file is not read.

     If Common processing is enabled, and the output file is  not
     standard  output,  the  program writes the Common parameters
     <EM>prog</EM>, <EM>filename</EM>, <EM>start</EM>, and <EM>nan</EM> to record the program's name,
     the  name  of the output file, the starting record number of
     the output file (always 1), and the number of points in  the
     output file.

     ESPS Common  processing  may  be  disabled  by  setting  the
     environment  variable  USE_ESPS_COMMON  to  <EM>off</EM>. The default
     ESPS Common file is <EM>espscom</EM> in the  user's  home  directory.
     This  may  be  overidden by setting the environment variable
     ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of  Common  pro-
     cessing   is   determined   by   the   environment  variable
     ESPS_VERBOSE, with 0 causing no feedback and increasing lev-
     els causing increasingly detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE
     is not defined, a default value of 3 is assumed.


</PRE>
<H2>ESPS HEADERS</H2><PRE>
     The  output  header  is  a  new  FEA_SD  file  header,  with
     appropriate items copied from the input headers.

     The generic header item "record_freq", which must  have  the
     same  value  in  all  input files, is copied into the output
     header.


     The generic header item "start_time"  records  the  starting
     time  for each output channel.  It is a single number if all
     output channels have the same starting time; otherwise it is
     a  vector  with  one element per channel.  The starting time
     for a channel is its starting time in the input file plus an
     offset  in  case  the  data taken from the input file do not
     start with the first record.  The offset is given by (<EM>r</EM>-1)/<EM>f</EM>
     where  <EM>r</EM> is the starting record number in the input file and
     <EM>f</EM> is the  sampling  frequency  given  by  the  "record_freq"
     header  item.   The   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>J</STRONG> option can create complex channels
     whose real and imaginary parts  have  inconsistent  starting
     times.  When that happens, a warning message is printed, and
     the starting time for the  real  part  is  recorded  in  the
     "start_time" header item.

     If every input file has a "max_value" header item, then  the
     output  file  has  a  "max_value" header item containing the
     same information.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     Multiplex data from three input files to produce  an  output
     file  <EM>xxx</EM>.  Processing  begins  with the sampled data in the
     first record in each input file.  The output  file  has  the
     same length as the shortest input file.

          <EM>mux</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>bbb</EM> <EM>ccc</EM> <EM>xxx</EM>

     Start at time 0.5 in each input file and process 0.5 seconds
     of  data from each.  (Suppose the sampling frequency is 8000
     Hz, and the start times in the three input  files  are  0.0,
     0.0,  and  0.5.   Then the starting record numbers are 4001,
     4001, and 1, respectively.  The start  time  in  the  output
     file is 0.5 for all channels.)

          <EM>mux</EM> -<EM>s0</EM>.<EM>5</EM>:<EM>1</EM>.<EM>0</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>bbb</EM> <EM>ccc</EM> <EM>xxx</EM>

     Start at time 0.5 in file <EM>aaa</EM> and with the first  record  in
     the  other  two  input  files.  (With the assumptions of the
     previous example, the starting record numbers in  the  three
     input  files  are  4001,  1, and 1, respectively.  The start
     times in the output file header are 0.5 for data from  files
     <EM>aaa</EM> and <EM>ccc</EM> and 0.0 for data from file <EM>bbb</EM>.)

          <EM>mux</EM> -<EM>s0</EM>.<EM>5</EM>: -<EM>p1</EM>: <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>bbb</EM> <EM>ccc</EM> <EM>xxx</EM>

     Juxtapose data from an input file with  a  test  signal  and
     pass the result to another program.

          <EM>testsd</EM> - | <EM>mux</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> - - | <EM>more</EM>_<EM>processing</EM> -

     If <EM>aaa</EM> has two channels of real data, this will  convert  it
     to a single-channel file <EM>zzz</EM> of complex data.
          <EM>mux</EM> -<EM>J</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>zzz</EM>

     If <EM>aaa</EM> and <EM>bbb</EM> are single-channel files of real  data,  this
     will join them into a single-channel file of complex data.

          <EM>mux</EM> -<EM>J</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>bbb</EM> <EM>zzz</EM>

     Multiplex a portion of a file with a later  portion  of  the
     same file.

          <EM>mux</EM> -<EM>p1001</EM>:<EM>2000</EM> -<EM>p2501</EM>: <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>aaa</EM> <EM>xxx</EM>

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
     The program exits with an error message if any of  the  fol-
     lowing occur.
       The command line cannot be parsed.
       Fewer than two file names are specified (one in, one out).
       Fewer input file names are specified than <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, and  <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>s</STRONG>
     options.
       More than one input file name is ``-''.
       An input file cannot be opened or is not an ESPS  sampled-
     data file.
       The input files do not all have  the  same  sampling  fre-
     quency.
       The input files do not all have the same data type.
       The <STRONG>-J</STRONG> option is specified with input files of  a  complex
     data type.
       The <STRONG>-J</STRONG> option is specified, and the total number of  input
     channels is odd.
       A starting record specified with a <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or  <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>s</STRONG>  option
     does not exist in all the files that the option applies to.

     The program issues a warning message if the end of  a  range
     specified  by a <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option is not reached, and the
     option argument (see  the  Options  section)  ends  with  an
     explicit <EM>last</EM>, <EM>end</EM>, or <STRONG>+</STRONG><EM>incr</EM>.  (This doesn't apply to option
     arguments that default to end-of-file by omitting what  fol-
     lows  the  colon.)   The  end  of  the  range may fail to be
     reached either because the end of an input file  is  reached
     first or because another <STRONG>-p</STRONG>, <STRONG>-r</STRONG>, or <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option causes an ear-
     lier stop.

     The program issues a warning message if processing for the <STRONG>-</STRONG>
     <STRONG>J</STRONG>  option  joins  two  channels  that are not properly time-
     aligned (so that they would require conflicting  entries  in
     the output "start_time" header item).
