.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs convert filter data between ESPS file types
FEA_FILT and FILT. 
Note that the 
FEA_FILT file type is meant to replace the FILT file type.
\fIfilt2fea\fP reads the header from
the FILT file \fIfilt_file\fP, allocates an appropriate FEA_FILT
header, reads the specified FILT records from \fIfilt_file\fP, and
transforms them to FEA_FILT records which are written to the new FEA_FILT
file \fIfea_filt_file\fP. \fIfea2filt\fP converts the FEA_FILT file 
\fIfea_filt_file\fP to a new FILT file \fIfilt_filt\fP in the same way.
All header items, both generic and those defined in the header,
are copied from the source header to the destination
header. 
.PP
Note that additional fields cannot be added to FILT records, so
\fIfea2filt\fP 
copies only the FEA_FILT record fields \fInum_degree,
denom_degree, num_coeff,\fP and \fIdenom_coeff\fP to
the destination FILT file.  Other fields in the FEA_FILT file are not
copied. 
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param" "\fR [params]\fP"
Specifies the name of the parameter file.
.TP
.BI \-r " range"
Select a range of records to be processed.  The default is
all the records in the source file. (See
.I grange_switch(3\-ESPS) 
for full details of generic range specification.)
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level" "\fR [0]\fP"
Increasing values provide a more detailed running commentary
on the program's progress. The default level is zero, which causes no
debug output.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
The parameter file does not have to be present, since all the
parameters have default values.
The following parameters are read, if present, from the parameter
file: 
.TP
.I "start \- integer"
.IP
This is the first record of the source file to process.  The default
is 1. 
It is not read if an initial record is specfied by the \fB\-r\fP option.
.TP
.I "nan \- integer"
.IP
This is the number of records to process.  It is not read if the
\fB\-r\fP option is used to specify the last record to be processed.
A value of zero means all subsequent records in the file; this is the
default. 
.TP
.I "debug_level \- integer"
.IP
Not read if the \fB-x\fP option is used.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
The common file is not read.
.SH ESPS HEADERS
No information is lost when transforming a FILT file to a FEA_FILT
file. No information is lost when transforming a FEA_FILT file to a
FILT file if no additional fields have been added to the FEA_FILT
file.  \fIcopy_genhd\fP (3\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) is used to duplicate
the source generic header items in the destination header.
