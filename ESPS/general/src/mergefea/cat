     If _f_e_a_1 and _f_e_a_2 both exist, _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a merges  their  records
     in  the sense that the fields in each output record comprise
     the union of fields in two input records.   The  results  of
     the  merge  can be written to a third file _f_e_a_3, or _f_e_a_2 can
     be rewritten to contain the merged results (think of this as
     merging  _f_e_a_1 into _f_e_a_2).  The ----ffff option can be used to res-
     trict which fields are taken from the _f_e_a_1 records. If  _f_e_a_2
     doesn't  exist, it is created and contains only the selected
     fields from _f_e_a_1 (thus,  _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a  can  be  used  to  filter
     fields out of FEA files).

     If both input files exist, then each record  of  the  output
     contains  all  of  the  fields  from  the corresponding _f_e_a_2
     record and the selected fields from the  corresponding  _f_e_a_1
     record  (all of them unless the ----ffff option is used).  None of
     the selected fields from _f_e_a_1 may have the same  name  as  a
     field  in   _f_e_a_2.  The size of the output file is determined
     by the size of _f_e_a_2 - they have the same number of  records.
     If  _f_e_a_1  has  more  records  than _f_e_a_2, then the additional
     records are ignored.  If _f_e_a_1 has fewer records  than  _f_e_a_2,
     then  the field values in the last record of _f_e_a_1 are dupli-
     cated for merging with the additional _f_e_a_2 records.  If _f_e_a_3
     is  supplied,  then  the  output is written to _f_e_a_3, and the
     original contents of _f_e_a_2 are left unchanged.   If  _f_e_a_3  is
     not  supplied,  then the contents of the output file replace
     the previous contents of _f_e_a_2.  That is,  _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a  rewrites
     _f_e_a_2 with additional fields in each record.

     If _f_e_a_2  does not exist, it is created as  an  output  file,
     and _f_e_a_3 must not be supplied.

     Generic header items are copied from input  to  output.   If
     _f_e_a_1  and  _f_e_a_2 contain header items with the same name, the
     value in _f_e_a_2 prevails.  This behavior  can  be  changed  by
     using  the ----uuuu option, which causes all generics from _f_e_a_1 to
     be copied; unique new names are generated if generics by the
     same name already exist in _f_e_a_2).

     If _f_e_a_1 is "-", standard input is used.  If _f_e_a_3 is not sup-
     plied  and  _f_e_a_2  is  " -", standard output is used (in this
     case, _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a is just a field filter).  If _f_e_a_3 is supplied
     and  _f_e_a_2  is "-", standard input is used, but _f_e_a_1 and _f_e_a_2
     may not both be standard input.  If _f_e_a_3 is " - ",  standard

     The following options are supported:

     ----ffff _f_i_e_l_d__n_a_m_e
          Specifies a field name to be taken from _f_e_a_1.  If no ----ffff
          option is given, all fields are taken.  This option may
          be given more than once.

     ----tttt    This option makes the output file a  tagged  file  and
          causes  record _t_a_g values to be copied from _f_e_a_1 to the
          output file, along with the specified  feature  fields.
          If the option is not specified, then the output file is
          tagged if and only if _f_e_a_2 exists and  is  tagged,  and
          the _t_a_g values, if any, are copied from _f_e_a_2.

     ----uuuu    If generic header items in _f_e_a_1 have names that  exist
          already  as  generics in _f_e_a_2, this option causes those
          items in _f_e_a_1 to be copied with unique new  names  gen-
          erated by the use of _c_o_p_y__g_e_n_h_d__u_n_i_q (3-ESPS).  Numeri-
          cal digits are appended  to  the  generic  header  item
          names in order to render them unique (see _u_n_i_q__n_a_m_e (3-
          ESPS)).

     ----aaaa    If the selected fields in _f_e_a_1 and all fields in  _f_e_a_2
          have  non-conflicting  names, and if both _f_e_a_1 and _f_e_a_2
          have  the  generic   header   items   _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q   and
          _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e  defined,  then  this  option can be used to
          merge the files in a time-aligned manner.   The  output
          file  _f_e_a_3 has the same record frequency _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q as
          _f_e_a_2, and it consists of records that correspond to the
          time intersection of the two input files.  In case that
          input record frequencies differ, a  zero-th  order  (or
          nearest-neighbor)  interpolation scheme is performed on
          records of _f_e_a_1.

     ----xxxx _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l [0]
          If _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l is positive, _m_e_r_g_e_f_e_a outputs  debugging
          messages.   The  messages  proliferate  as  _d_e_b_u_g__l_e_v_e_l
          increases.  For level 0, there is no output.

     ----zzzz    Suppress the  warning  that  is  normally  printed  if
          _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q is defined with different values in the two
          input files.

     ----TTTT _F_E_A__s_u_b_t_y_p_e [(same as _f_e_a_2)]
          If this option is given, the feature file subtype  code
          in  the  output  file is filled in with the given code.
          The symbolic name of the subtype code  must  be  given,
          for  example  FEA_ANA  or FEA_SD (or NONE).  For a com-
          plete list of defined subtype codes, see FEA(5 - ESPS).

          Use of this option doesn't ensure that the file has the
          correct format for the specified subtype.   You  should
          use  this  option  only when you knows that a file with
          the correct fields and generic  header  items  will  be
          produced.   See  the  section  5  manual  pages for the
          defined feature file types.

     The generic header items from both input files are added  as
     generic  header items to the output file.  If generic header
     items with the same name exist  in  both  input  files,  the
     value from _f_e_a_2 is used (but see the ----uuuu option).

     The input files _f_e_a_1 and _f_e_a_2, if both exist, are  added  as
     source  files  in  the output header; otherwise only _f_e_a_1 is
     added.  The generic header items _s_t_a_r_t__t_i_m_e and  _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q
     are handled like any others.  In addition, if _r_e_c_o_r_d__f_r_e_q is
     defined with different values in the two  input  files,  the
     program  prints a warning.  The  ----zzzz option will suppress the
     warning.

     If _f_e_a_2 exists, its FEA subtype code  is  preserved  in  the
     output  unless  a  different choice is specified with the ----TTTT
     option.
