\fBINTRODUCTION\fP
.pp
This demonstration software provides a brief introduction to
Entropic's signal processing software -- the Entropic Signal
Processing System (ESPS), and the waves+ graphics interface.
.pp
The demo has two parts: "waves+ intro" and "slide show". The waves+
intro is a live demo that shows the software in action. The slide show
is a sequence of fixed ESPS and waves+ images.  The demo has an
optional voice narrative that describes what you see on the screen.  
This option may not be supported on all systems (and it can be turned 
off even on systems that support it).  Note that the text of the
narrative is contained at the end of the file that is displayed 
when the "About this demo..." button is pressed.  (This file usually
is erldemos/edemo.about).

.lp
\fBSETTING UP THE DEMO\fP
.pp
The tape contains a single tar image: the directory "entropic".  This
can be loaded anywhere; root privileges are not required.  Extract the
directory with "tar xv".
.pp
By setting your umask to 022 ("umask 022") before reading the tar
tape, anyone may execute the demo, but this is not necessary for a
single user.  The demo only requires write permission in the directory
/tmp, so changing the modes on the files to global read-and-execute
permission only ("chmod -R 555 entropic") will not break the demo.
.pp
Machine specific instructions and restrictions are found in the README 
in the "entropic" directory; general requirements and recommendations 
are as follows:
.sp
.nf
	1) color (8 planes) display for "slide show" (must).  A color display
	   is highly desirable for the "waves+ intro" portion, as many things 
	   will not work without one.  

	2) 25 MB disk space (must) 

	3) 16 MB memory highly recommended. You can try it with only 12 MB,
	   but the audio and slides may loose sync. With less than 12 MB,
	   things become sluggish and sometimes confusing; turn the audio off.

	4) X11R4 or greater based window manager

	5) swap space of at least 20 MB

.pp
A user must be standing in the "entropic" directory in order to run the demo. 
If you want to make it easy for anyone to run the demo, put a script in
/usr/local or /usr/local/bin that "cd"s to the "entropic" directory and 
runs ENTROPIC. 
.sp
.lp
\fBRUNNING THE DEMO\fP
.pp
To start the demo, change into the entropic directory ("cd entropic")
and run the program ENTROPIC.  This will put up a command window from
which the user can operate the demo.  
.pp
The top part of the control panel has buttons that present information
about the demo, ESPS, waves+, and the Entropic Research Laboratory.
.pp
The bottom part of the control panel allows you to select various demo
and audio options. By using the check boxes, you can select the live
part, the slide show or both.  The "Single" and "Continuous" buttons
determine whether the "Start Demo" button runs the demo once or 
continuously.  The "Audio Output" buttons control the play back 
options.  Once the options have been selected, clicking on the 
"Start demo" button starts the demo.
.pp
A single run of the demo takes between 5 and 8 minutes, depending
on the system.
For more information about running the demo, see the file displayed 
when the "About this demo..." button is pressed. 
.sp
.lp
\fBCONFIGURATION CONSIDERATIONS\fP
.pp
The OpenLook fonts (supplied here) must be on your path before the demo
will run. The ENTROPIC demo script tries to do this for you, but if the
demo won't run and you see error messages in the ENTROPIC.log file (found
on /tmp) about fonts, move to the "xview" directory and do the following 
before running the ENTROPIC command:
.sp
.nf
	source setxview.
.sp
.fi
.pp
In general, the performance of the demo varies as a function of the
system configuration and load (CPU speed, disk speed, available
memory, role of NFS, network traffic, swap space, other processes,
etc.).  Since there is no foolproof method of synchronizing speech
output with the actual appearance of particular windows; inadequate
system resources may result not just in a slower demo, but in a
confusing demo. If the demo is not smooth, try running it without 
speech output.
