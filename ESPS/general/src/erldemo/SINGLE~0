#top level waves command file for demo
#
#waves is called with this command file to run the demo; waves exits at the end
#
#all command files called from this file must be independent modules; 
#that is, they should make no assumptions about the state of displays that
#exist when they start, and they should not prepare displays or change the 
#waves state in ways needed by subsequent command files; usually, these 
#files end with a "kill" command to clear all displays.
#
#since this is top level file, the first line must start with "waves"
