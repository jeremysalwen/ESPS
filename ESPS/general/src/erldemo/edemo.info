ESPS is an extension of unix for signal processing.  It provides a
well-engineered environment for end-users and algorithm developers.
Features include more than 130 user-level programs, more than 250 C
library functions, automatic record-keeping, machine-independent file
interchange, on-line manual pages, and a self-describing,
object-oriented file system.

waves+ provides an interactive graphics interface coordinating
multiple window presentations for viewing, editing, segmenting,
labeling, and processing ESPS signal files.  ESPS programs can be
called from within waves+.

ESPS and waves+ are based on accepted standards: UNIX, C, NFS, and X
Windows.

Both ESPS and waves+ operate under a floating license manager that
permits distribution of copies over a network of workstations.

Third-party signal processing and I/O boards are available for use
with ESPS and waves+ on Sun 3 (VME-bus), Sun 4/SPARCstation (VME-bus)
and Sun 386i (AT-bus).  An S-bus card with signal I/O support will be
available later this year.
