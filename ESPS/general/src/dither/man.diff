.SH "NAME"
dither \- add half-tone bit-map version of spectrogram to FEA_SPEC or other FEA file.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B dither
[
.BI \-x " debug_level"
] [
.BI \-P " params"
]
.I "input.fea output.fea"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I Dither
accepts a FEA file
.I input.fea
containing a vector field of power-spectrum values in each record.
It produces a FEA file
.I output.fea
with records that are copies of the input records plus an additional
field containing 1s and 0s intended for display as a simulated
gray-scale spectrogram on a black-and-white monitor.
The default name for the spectral-value field in
.I input.fea
is
.I re_spec_val,
and the default name for the new field in
.I output.fea
is
.I dith_spec_val.
Both defaults can be changed by means of entries in a parameter file.
If
.I input.fea
is "\-", standard input is used for the input file.
If
.I output.fea
is "\-", standard input is used for the output file.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-P " param" " \fR[params]\fP"
Specifies the name of the parameter file.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level"
Positive values of
.I debug_level
cause debugging information to be printed;
higher values produce more messages.
The default value is 0, which suppresses the messages.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The parameter file does not have to be present,
since all the parameters have default values.
The following parameters are read, if present, from the parameter file:
.TP
.I "spec_field_name \- string"
.IP
This is the name of the spectral-value data field in
.I input.fea.
The default is "re_spec_val".
.TP
.I "dspec_field_name \- string"
.IP
This is the name of the half-tone (``dithered'') field in
.I output.fea.
The default is "dith_spec_val".
.TP
.I "start \- integer"
.IP
This is the first record of \fIinput\fP to process.
The default is 1.
.TP
.I "nan \- integer"
.IP
This is the number of records to process.
A value of zero means all subsequent records in the file;
this is the default.
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.PP
ESPS Common is not processed by 
.I dither
if \fIinput\fP is 
standard input.  Otherwise, provided that the Common file is newer 
than the parameter file, and provided that the \fIfilename\fP entry in 
Common matches \fIinput\fP, the Common values for \fIstart\fP and 
\fInan\fP override those that may be present in the parameter file. 
.PP
The following items are written into the ESPS Common file 
provided that \fIoutput\fP is not <stdout>.  
.IP
.I "start \- integer"
.IP
The starting point from the input file.
.sp
.I "nan \- integer"
.IP
The number of points in the selected range.
.sp
.I "prog \- string"
.IP
This is the name of the program 
.RI ( dither
in this case).
.sp
.I "filename \- string"
.IP
The name of the input file
.I input.fea.
.SH ESPS HEADERS
The output header is a new FEA file header, with appropriate items
being copied from the input header, including all generic header items.
As usual, the command line is added as a comment and the header of
.I input.fea
is added as a source file to
.I output.
Another comment gives the name of the field added by
.I dither.
.SH "FUTURE CHANGES"
.PP
Command-line options for setting the parameters
.I start,
.I nan,
.I spec_field_name,
and
.I dspec_field_name.
Explicit controls over thresholds used by the dithering algorithm.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fIimage\fR (1-ESPS), FEA (5-ESPS), FEA_SPEC (5-ESPS)
.SH "WARNINGS AND DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
.I Dither
will exit with an error message
if the output field name conflicts
with the name of a field in the input file,
if the spectral-value field does not exist in the input file,
if the values of
.I start
and
.I nan
are inconsistent,
or if the program had problems in allocating memory,
creating the output field, or writing to common.
Also, the input field must be of type BYTE or FLOAT.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
None known.  
.SH "AUTHOR"
