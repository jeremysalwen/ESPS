.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Pplain
prints data values from an ESPS file, without headers or other extraneous
information.  ESPS files consist of a series of records; there may be multiple
elements per record. By default, all data from all records are printed,
excluding position tags, if any.  Each line of the output contains the values
from a single record, separated by spaces.  \fIFile\fR must be an ESPS
data file.   If \fIfile\fR is "-", then the standard input is read.
.PP
The
.B \-r
option may be used to select a subset of the records in the file for printing;
all range formats accepted by the range_switch function are legal.  In
particular, a single integer or two integers separated by a colon form a legal
range.
.PP
The
.B \-e
option may be used to select a subset of elements within each record for
printing; if the ESPS file has position tags 
element 0 may be specified and refers to the tag, otherwise the first element
is element 1.  The range is parsed as a "generic" range.  See
\fIgrange_switch(3\-ESPS)\fP for more details.
The programs \fIgen_element(1\-ESPS)\fR and \fIfea_element(1\-ESPS)\fR
can be used to get element number information for a file.
.PP
The 
.B \-f 
option can only be used with ESPS feature files.  This allows
specifying a feature file field and element range within that field.
Only one \fB\-f\fR option can be used.  To print more than one field
(but not all), use the \fB\-e\fR option.   A \fIfield_range\fR is a
field name, followed by an optional generic element range in brackets.
For example to print elements 1 through 5, and 7 of field
\fIspec_param\fR you would use \fI\-f spec_param[1-5,7]\fR.  Since the
bracket has special meaning to some Unix shells, you may have to quote
the argument to the \fB\-f\fR option.
.PP
The
.B \-n
option (for native type) may only be used in conjunction with the
.B \-f
option.  It specifies printing the specified field in it's actual type
rather than converting to double and printing.  Using this option will
cause any element ranges you specified on the -f option to be ignored.
.PP
The
.B \-i
option causes all printed values to be rounded to the nearest integer.
.SH ESPS PARAMETERS
.PP
This program does not access the parameter file.
.SH ESPS COMMON
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off".  The default ESPS Common file is .espscom 
in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.PP
The following items are read from the ESPS Common File provided that
standard input isn't used.  
.IP
.I "filename - string"
.IP
This is the name of the input file.  If no input file is 
specified on the command line, \fIfilename\fP is taken to be the
input file.  If an input file is specified on the command line, 
that input file name must match \fIfilename\fP or the other 
items (below) are not read from Common. 
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
This is the starting record in the input file to begin printing.  It 
is not read if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.  
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
This is the number of records to print from the input file.  It is not
read if the \fB\-r\fP option is used.  A value of zero means the last
record in the file.
.sp
.PP
Again, the values of \fIstart\fR and \fInan\fR are only used if the
input file on the command line is the same as \fIfilename\fP in the
common file, or if no input file was given on the command line.  If
\fIstart\fR and/or \fInan\fR are not given in the common file, or if
the common file can't be opened for reading, then \fIstart\fR
defaults to the beginning of the file and \fInan\fR defaults to the
number of records in the file.
.PP
The following items are written into the ESPS Common file:
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The starting record from the input file.
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The number of records in the selected range.
.sp
.I "prog - string"
.IP
This is the name of the program (\fIpplain\fP in this case).
.sp
.I "filename - string"
.IP
The name of the input file. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.nf
pplain: file is not an ESPS file.
pplain: please specify last element explicitly.
pplain: no tags in file; cannot print element 0.
pplain: only %d elements per record in file
pplain: only %d elements in field %s.
pplain: -f option can only be used with feature files.
pplain: no such field in file.
.PP
Sphere, esignal, and pc wave file formats are not supported. Use
"copysps infile - | pplain -" to achieve the same effect.
.fi
.SH BUGS
.PP
The \fB-e\fR does not work corretly if the file contains fields of a
complex data type.   The real and imaginary part of a complex field are
considered separate elements in pplain, even though
\fIfea_element(1\-ESPS)\fR reports a complex field as one element.   This
is a bug and will be resolved.
