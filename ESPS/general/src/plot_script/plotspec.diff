.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I plotspec
plots records from ESPS spectral-feature-record (FEA_SPEC) files.
These files can be created by the
.I me_spec
command.
More than one record may be plotted, superposed on one set of axes.
If the input file is ``\-'', the standard input is
read.
.PP
The default action is to plot the contents of the
.I re_spec_val
field of the input records and,
if the type is SPTYP_CPLX, the contents of
.I im_spec_val
as well.
However, alternative output formats are available with the
.BR \-d ,
.BR \-D ,
and
.BR \-F
options.
When the spectrum type is SPTYP_REAL and a power is required,
as with the
.BR \-d
and
.BR \-D
options,
the square of
.I re_spec_val
is used.
.PP
.mc |
By default,
the output is in Unix GPS (``Graphics Primitive String'') format
and is displayed on the Masscomp or Sun display,
but with the
.B \-T
option, this may be sent to the standard output,
obtained in Tektronix format rather than GPS,
or plotted on a hardcopy device.
.mc
.PP
.mc |
On Masscomp systems the color and line style of output to 
``gps'' or ``mcd'' depend on the
environment variable BUNDLE.  The default is GPS bundle number 20, which
gives solid lines on monochrome displays.
.mc

On a Sun workstation (not running X windows), 
this program must be run from within the
\fISuntools\fR window system.  The plot will appear in a new window,
which can be moved, resized, closed (reduced to an icon), and removed by
using the functions on the \fISuntools\fR menu.   To get this menu, move
the mouse cursor to the title bar of the plot window and press the right
mouse button.
.mc
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported.
.TP
.BI \-d
Plot the power spectrum cumulative distribution function.
.TP
.BI \-l
Plot frequencies on a logarithmic scale (labeled in decades).
When the vertical scale is in dB, this option results in Bode-plot format.
.TP
.BI \-r " first" : "last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first" :+ "incr"
.TP
.BI \-r " frame"
Range of records to be plotted.
The default range is the entire file.
In the first form, a pair of unsigned integers gives the first and last
records of the range.
The first frame in the file counts as number 1
regardless of any reference file.
If
.I first
is omitted, 1 is used.
If
.I last
is omitted, the last record of the file is used.
The second form is equivalent to the first with
.IR last " = " first " + " incr.
The third form is equivalent to
.BI \-r " frame" : "frame."
.TP
.BI \-t " text"
A line of text to be printed below the plot.  If this option is specified
more than once, the lines are printed in the order given.
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-x "debug_level"
.mc
If
.I debug_level
is nonzero, debugging information is written to the standard error output.
The higher the level, the more messages are written.
Default is 0 (no debugging output).
.TP
.BI \-y " low" : "high"
Data range.  Specifies spectral values for the lower and upper
.IR y -axis
limits.  If
.I low
or
.I high
is unspecified, the limit is determined from the file contents.
The values are adjusted by
.I plotspec
in an attempt to make an esthetically pleasing plot.
To specify exact limits, use
.B \-Y
instead.
.TP
.BI \-D
Plot the logarithmically scaled power (in dB) regardless of whether
the spectrum type is SPTYP_DB or not.
The arguments of the
.B \-y
and
.B \-Y
options are interpreted in dB.
.TP
.BI \-F
Plot the phase of complex data, rather than the real and imaginary parts.
The input file must contain data of type SPTYP_CPLX.
.mc |
The verical axis is scaled in radians, from \-\*(pi to \*(pi,
.mc
and the
.B \-y
and
.B \-Y
options are ignored.
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-T " device"
.I Device
may be
.BR gps ,
.BR mcd ,
.BR tek ,
.BR suntools ,
.BR hp ,
or
.BR hardcopy .
The default is
.BR \-Tmcd,
which displays the output on the worstation graphics screen by piping it through
.IR mcd
or
.IR xmcd.
The program \fImcd\fR is supplied by Masscomp for their systems, and by
ESI for other workstations.
Specifying
.B \-Tgps
sends output to the standard output in Masscomp Unix GPS format.
Specifying
.B \-Ttek
causes output to be sent to the standard output in Tektronix 4000-series
format.
If
.B \-Tsuntools
is used, then the display will be forced to use \fIsuntools\fR window
system (on Suns and Solbournes only), even if ESPS has been configured
to use the X window system.   If ESPS is built for X, then it uses X for
plotting by default.
.B \-Thp
produces output for an HP LaserJet printer.   Note that the output is
produced on standard out and it is not spooled to the printer by this
command.   Use of this option will result in about 750K bytes of output
per page.   If the link to your LaserJet is slow, it might take
several minutes to send it to the printer.    
In a later version, this will be merged with the
\fIhardcopy\fR option above for direct spooling.
If
.B \-Tmcd
is used on a Masscomp and ESPS has been configured to use X windows,
then the old SP-40 \fImcd\fR is used instead of X windows.
Specifying
.B \-Thardcopy
plots it on a hardcopy device, if one was set up in the installation
script.  Note that the word \fIimagen\fR was used for this option in
previous versions.   It is still accepted, but \fIhardcopy\fR is meant
to be more general.
.TP
.mc
.BI \-W
This option is followed by a character
.mc |
string consisting of the generic window system options.   These options are
passed onto \fImcd\fR or \fIxmcd\fR.   
This option is used to pass along generic X window
arguments to \fIxmcd\fR or Suntool arguments to \fImcd\fR on Suns.  This
option might not have an effect on all systems.   For example, on a
system running X windows, to cause the plot to appear at a particular
screen location the following command could be used: 
.br
\fIplotspec -W "=300x250+50+200" file\fR.
.br
See \fImcd(1\-ESPS)\fR and \fIxmcd(1\-ESPS)\fR for details.
.mc
.TP
.BI \-X " low" : "high"
.TP
.BI \-X " limit"
Frequency range.  Specifies frequency values for the lower and upper
.IR x- axis
limits.  If
.I low
or
.I high
is omitted, the limit is determined from the file contents.
The second form is equivalent to
.BR \-X " 0" : \fIlimit\fP
if the header value
.I freq_format
is SPFMT_SYM_CTR or SPFMT_SYM_EDGE and to
.BI \-X " \-limit" : "limit"
otherwise.
.TP
.BI \-Y " range"
Specifies exact lower and upper limits for the
.IR y- axis.
.PP
.mc |
For Sun systems, this program will plot under either X windows, or
Suntools.   By default, if the \fB-T\fR option is not used, it will 
expect X windows.   To plot under Suntools you can use the \fB-Tsuntools\fR
option.    If you always use Suntools, you can avoid using the \fB-T\fR
option by defining the environment variable \fBEPLOTDEV\fR to be
\fIsuntools\fR.  This will make the Suntools window system the default.
This variable is ignored if the machine type is not Sun4, SUN3, or
SUN386i.
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
.BI "plotspec " "<options> <filename>"
.PP
is equivalent to
.IP
.BI "plotspec \-Tgps " "<options> <filename> " "| mcd"
.PP
The second form may be used if nondefault options for
.I mcd
are desired.
.mc
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
The ESPS parameter file is not read.
.SH "ESPS COMMON"
The ESPS common file is not read or written.
.SH "ESPS HEADERS"
The following values are explicitly read
from the header of the spectral-feature-record file:
.I common.type,
and the generic header items
.I num_freqs
and
.I freq_format.
In addition, the header is examined by the library routines
.I allo_feaspec_rec,
.I get_feaspec_rec,
and
.I put_feaspec_rec.
.SH SUBROUTINES CALLED
plotscale, drawbox, plot2data and printtime.
