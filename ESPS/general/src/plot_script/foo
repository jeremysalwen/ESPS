<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <EM>Scatplot</EM> makes a scatter plot of pairs of elements from mul-
     tiple  ESPS files <EM>file1</EM>, <EM>file2</EM>, . . . .  When used as a file
     name, ``-'' denotes standard input.

     By default, the output is in Unix GPS (``Graphics  Primitive
     String'')  format  and  is  displayed on the Masscomp or Sun
     display, but with the <STRONG>-T</STRONG> option, this may  be  sent  to  the
     standard  output,  obtained  in Tektronix format rather than
     GPS, or plotted on a hardcopy device.

     On a Sun workstation, this program must be run  from  within
     the  <EM>Suntools</EM>  window system.  The plot will appear in a new
     window, which can be moved, resized, closed (reduced  to  an
     icon),  and  removed  by using the functions on the <EM>Suntools</EM>
     menu.   To get this menu, move the mouse cursor to the title
     bar of the plot window and press the right mouse button.

     If the <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option is omitted, then the entire contents of all
     files are plotted.

     The <STRONG>-e</STRONG> option specifies which elements  to  plot.   An  even
     number  of  elements must always be given since there are no
     default elements to plot.  The first  pair  of  elements  is
     associated  with  the  first  file, the second pair with the
     second file, and so on up to the last file or until no other
     pair  of  elements  remains,  in which case the last pair of
     elements is associated with the remaining files.  The  first
     element  in  the  pair  is  plotted  as the abscissa and the
     second element as the ordinate.  Default symbols are used to
     distinguish between multiple files, but they can be overrid-
     den by the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option.

     <EM>Scatplot</EM> finds the maximum and minimum of the <EM>x</EM>  values  and
     the  <EM>y</EM> values in the specified ranges of the input files and
     computes appropriate scales This automatic  scaling  can  be
     overridden by the <STRONG>-X</STRONG> and <STRONG>-Y</STRONG> options.

     On Masscomp systems the color and line style  of  output  to
     ``gps''  or  ``mcd'' depend on the environment variable BUN-
     DLE.  The default is GPS bundle number 20, which gives solid
     lines on monochrome displays.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The following options are supported:

     <STRONG>-e</STRONG> <EM>elements</EM>
          Determine which elements within a record to plot.   The
          elements  may  be  separated  by  commas, or, more gen-
          erally, any construct  acceptable  to  <EM>grange</EM>_<EM>switch</EM>(3-
          ESPSu)  may  be used, as long as the number of elements
          specified is even.  The first pair of elements is asso-
          ciated  with  the  first file, the second pair with the
          second file, and so on up to the last file or until  no
          other  pair of elements remains, in which case the last
          pair of  elements  is  associated  with  the  remaining
          files.  The first element in the pair is plotted as the
          abscissa and the second element as the ordinate.

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <EM>first</EM>:<EM>last</EM>

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <EM>first</EM>:+<EM>incr</EM>
          Determines the range of records to be plotted.  In  the
          first form, a pair of unsigned integers gives the first
          and last records of the range. If <EM>first</EM> is  omitted,  1
          is  used.   If  <EM>last</EM> is omitted, the last record in the
          file is used.  The second form  is  equivalent  to  the
          first with <EM>last</EM> = <EM>first</EM> + <EM>incr</EM> .

     This option may be repeated.  The first <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option applies to
     the  first  input  file,  the second <STRONG>-r</STRONG> option to the second
     input file, and so on.  If there are more  files  than   <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>r</STRONG>
     options,  then  the  last  option  applies  to all remaining
     files.

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG> <EM>symbols</EM> [<EM>xo</EM>*<EM>abcdefghijklmnpqrstuvwyz</EM>]
          Plot the scatter plot using the symbols specified.  The
          first  symbol  is  used  for the first file, the second
          symbol for the second file, and so on up  to  the  last
          file.  There must be at least as many symbols as files.
          The default symbols are given in brackets.

     The positions of the symbols `<EM>x</EM>' and `<EM>o</EM>' have been  modified
     so  that the plotting point falls very close to the "center"
     of the character.  Other  characters  will  not  have  their
     centers exactly at the plotting points.

     <STRONG>-t</STRONG> <EM>text</EM>
          Print a line of text above the graph.

     <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>level</EM>
          If <EM>level</EM> is nonzero, debugging information  is  written
          to  the standard error output.  Default is 0 (no debug-
          ging output).

     <STRONG>-H</STRONG> <EM>text</EM>
          Print a line of text below the graph.

     <STRONG>-T</STRONG> <EM>device</EM>
          <EM>Device</EM> may be <STRONG>gps</STRONG>, <STRONG>mcd</STRONG>, <STRONG>tek</STRONG>, <STRONG>suntools</STRONG>, <STRONG>hp</STRONG>, or <STRONG>hardcopy</STRONG>.
          The  default is <STRONG>-Tmcd,</STRONG> which displays the output on the
          workstation graphics screen by piping it through <EM>mcd</EM>(1)
          or  <STRONG><A HREF="../man1.html/xmcd.1.html">xmcd(1 - ESPS)</A></STRONG>.   The  program  <EM>mcd</EM>  is supplied by
          Masscomp for their systems, and by ESI for other works-
          tations.  Specifying <STRONG>-Tgps</STRONG> sends output to the standard
          output in Masscomp Unix GPS format.  Specifying  <STRONG>-</STRONG> <STRONG>Ttek</STRONG>
          causes output to be sent to the standard output in Tek-
          tronix 4000-series format.  If <STRONG>-Tsuntools</STRONG> is used, then
          the  display will be forced to use <EM>suntools</EM> window sys-
          tem (on Suns and Solbournes only),  even  if  ESPS  has
          been  configured  to use the X window system.   If ESPS
          is built for X, then it uses X for plotting by default.
          If   <STRONG>-Tmcd</STRONG> is used on a Masscomp and ESPS has been con-
          figured to use X windows, then the  old  SP-40  <EM>mcd</EM>  is
          used instead of X windows.  Specifying <STRONG>-Thardcopy</STRONG> plots
          it on a hardcopy device, if one was set up in the  ins-
          tallation  script.   Note that the word <EM>imagen</EM> was used
          for this option in previous  versions.    It  is  still
          accepted,  but <EM>hardcopy</EM> is meant to be more general.  <STRONG>-</STRONG>
          <STRONG>Thp</STRONG> produces output for an HP LaserJet printer.    Note
          that  the  output is produced on standard out and it is
          not spooled to the printer by this  command.    Use  of
          this  option  will result in about 750K bytes of output
          per page.   If the link to your LaserJet  is  slow,  it
          might  take  several minutes to send it to the printer.
          In a later version, this will be merged with the  <EM>hard-</EM>
          <EM>copy</EM> option above for direct spooling.

     <STRONG>-V</STRONG> <EM>text</EM>
          Print a line of text along the left side of  the  graph
          going upwards.

     <STRONG>-X</STRONG> <EM>low</EM>:<EM>high</EM>
          Specifies lower and upper limits for the  x-axis,  dis-
          ables automatic computation of limits.

     <STRONG>-Y</STRONG> <EM>low</EM>:<EM>high</EM>
          Specifies lower and upper limits for the  y-axis,  dis-
          ables automatic computation of limits.

     <STRONG>-W</STRONG>    This option is followed by a character string consist-
          ing  of  the  generic  window  system  options.   These
          options are passed onto <EM>mcd</EM> or  <EM>xmcd</EM>.  This  option  is
          used  to  pass along generic X window arguments to <EM>xmcd</EM>
          or Suntool arguments to <EM>mcd</EM> on Suns.  This option might
          not  have an effect on all systems.   For example, on a
          system running X windows, to cause the plot  to  appear
          at  a  particular screen location the following command
          could be used:
          <EM>scatplot</EM> -<EM>W</EM> "=<EM>300x250</EM>+<EM>50</EM>+<EM>200</EM>" <EM>file</EM>.
          See <STRONG><A HREF="../man1.html/mcd.1.html">mcd(1-ESPS)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="../man1.html/xmcd.1.html">xmcd(1-ESPS)</A></STRONG> for details.

     For Sun systems, this program will plot under either X  win-
     dows,  or  Suntools.    By  default, if the <STRONG>-T</STRONG> option is not
     used, it will expect X windows.   To plot under Suntools you
     can  use  the  <STRONG>-Tsuntools</STRONG>  option.    If you always use Sun-
     tools, you can avoid using the <STRONG>-T</STRONG>  option  by  defining  the
     environment  variable  <STRONG>EPLOTDEV</STRONG>  to  be <EM>suntools</EM>.  This will
     make the Suntools window system the default.  This  variable
     is  ignored  if  the  machine  type  is  not  Sun4, SUN3, or
     SUN386i.
