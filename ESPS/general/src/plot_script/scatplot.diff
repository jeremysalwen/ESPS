.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Scatplot
makes a scatter plot of pairs of elements from multiple ESPS files
.I file1, file2, . . . .
When used as a file name, ``\-'' denotes standard input.
.PP
.mc |
By default,
the output is in Unix GPS (``Graphics Primitive String'') format
and is displayed on the Masscomp or Sun display, but with the
.B \-T
option, this may be sent to the standard output,
obtained in Tektronix format rather than GPS,
or plotted on a hardcopy device.
.mc
.PP

On a Sun workstation, this program must be run from within the
\fISuntools\fR window system.  The plot will appear in a new window,
which can be moved, resized, closed (reduced to an icon), and removed by
using the functions on the \fISuntools\fR menu.   To get this menu, move
the mouse cursor to the title bar of the plot window and press the right
mouse button.
.mc
.PP
.mc *
.mc
If the \fB\-r\fP option is omitted, then the entire contents
of all files are plotted.
.PP
The \fB\-e\fP option specifies which elements to plot.  An even
number of elements must always be given since there are no default
elements to plot.  The first pair of elements is associated with the first
file, the second pair with the second file, and so
on up to the last file or until no other pair of elements remains, in
which case the last pair of elements is associated with the remaining
files.  The first element in the pair is plotted as the abscissa
and the second element as the ordinate.  Default symbols are used
to distinguish between multiple files, but they can be overridden by
the \fB\-s\fP option.  
.PP
.I Scatplot
finds the maximum and minimum of the
.I x
values and the
.I y
values in the specified ranges of the input files
and computes appropriate scales
This automatic scaling can be overridden by the
.B \-X
and
.B \-Y
options.
.mc |
.PP
On Masscomp systems the color and line style of output to ``gps'' or ``mcd'' depend on the
environment variable BUNDLE.  The default is GPS bundle number 20, which
gives solid lines on monochrome displays.
.mc
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-e " elements"
Determine which elements within a record to plot.
The elements may be separated by commas, or, more generally,
any construct acceptable to
.IR grange_switch (3-ESPSu)
may be used, as long as the number of elements specified is even.
The first pair of elements is associated with the first
file, the second pair with the second file, and so
on up to the last file or until no other pair of elements remains,
in which case the last pair of elements is associated with the remaining
files.
The first element in the pair is plotted as the abscissa
and the second element as the ordinate.
.TP
.BI \-r " first:last"
.TP
.BI \-r " first:+incr
Determines the range of records to be plotted.  In the first form, a
pair of unsigned integers gives the first and last records of the range.  
If 
.I first
is omitted, 1 is used.  If 
.I last 
is omitted, the last record in the file is used.  The second form is
equivalent to the first with 
.I "last = first + incr".
.mc |
.PP
.mc
This option may be repeated.
The first
.B \-r
option applies to the first input file, the second
.B \-r
option to the second input file, and so on.
If there are more files than
.B \-r
options, then the last option applies to all remaining files.
.TP
.BI \-s " symbols \fR[\fPxo*abcdefghijklmnpqrstuvwyz\fR]\fP"
Plot the scatter plot using the symbols specified.
The first symbol is used for the first file,
the second symbol for the second file,
and so on up to the last file.
There must be at least as many symbols as files.
The default symbols are given in brackets.  
.mc |
.PP
.mc
The positions of the symbols
.I `x'
and
.I `o'
have been modified so that the plotting point falls very close to
the "center" of the character.  Other characters will not have their
centers exactly at the plotting points.
.TP
.BI \-t " text"
Print a line of text above the graph.
.TP
.BI \-x " level"
If
.I level
is nonzero, debugging information is written to the standard error output.
Default is 0 (no debugging output).
.TP
.BI \-H " text"
Print a line of text below the graph.
.TP
.mc |
.BI \-T " device"
.I Device
may be
.BR gps ,
.BR mcd ,
.BR tek ,
.BR suntools ,
.BR hp ,
or
.BR hardcopy .
The default is
.BR \-Tmcd,
which displays the output on the workstation graphics screen by piping it through
.IR mcd (1)
or
.IR xmcd (1\-ESPS).
The program \fImcd\fR is supplied by Masscomp for their systems, and by
ESI for other workstations.
Specifying
.B \-Tgps
sends output to the standard output in Masscomp Unix GPS format.
Specifying
.B \-Ttek
causes output to be sent to the standard output in Tektronix 4000-series
format.
If
.B \-Tsuntools
is used, then the display will be forced to use \fIsuntools\fR window
system (on Suns and Solbournes only), even if ESPS has been configured
to use the X window system.   If ESPS is built for X, then it uses X for
plotting by default.
If
.B \-Tmcd
is used on a Masscomp and ESPS has been configured to use X windows,
then the old SP-40 \fImcd\fR is used instead of X windows.
Specifying
.B \-Thardcopy
plots it on a hardcopy device, if one was set up in the installation
script.  Note that the word \fIimagen\fR was used for this option in
previous versions.   It is still accepted, but \fIhardcopy\fR is meant
to be more general.
.B \-Thp
produces output for an HP LaserJet printer.   Note that the output is
produced on standard out and it is not spooled to the printer by this
command.   Use of this option will result in about 750K bytes of output
per page.   If the link to your LaserJet is slow, it might take
several minutes to send it to the printer.    
In a later version, this will be merged with the
\fIhardcopy\fR option above for direct spooling.
.TP
.mc
.BI \-V " text"
Print a line of text along the left side of the graph going upwards.
.TP
.BI \-X " low:high"
Specifies lower and upper limits for the x-axis, disables
automatic computation of limits.
.TP
.BI \-Y " low:high"
Specifies lower and upper limits for the y-axis, disables
automatic computation of limits.
.TP
.BI \-W
This option is followed by a character
.mc |
string consisting of the generic window system options.   These options are
passed onto \fImcd\fR or \fIxmcd\fR.   
This option is used to pass along generic X window
arguments to \fIxmcd\fR or Suntool arguments to \fImcd\fR on Suns.  This
option might not have an effect on all systems.   For example, on a
.mc
system running X windows, to cause the plot to appear at a particular
screen location the following command could be used: 
.mc *
.mc
.br
\fIscatplot -W "=300x250+50+200" file\fR.
.mc |
.br
See \fImcd(1\-ESPS)\fR and \fIxmcd(1\-ESPS)\fR for details.
.mc

For Sun systems, this program will plot under either X windows, or
Suntools.   By default, if the \fB-T\fR option is not used, it will 
expect X windows.   To plot under Suntools you can use the \fB-Tsuntools\fR
option.    If you always use Suntools, you can avoid using the \fB-T\fR
option by defining the environment variable \fBEPLOTDEV\fR to be
\fIsuntools\fR.  This will make the Suntools window system the default.
This variable is ignored if the machine type is not Sun4, SUN3, or
SUN386i.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBscatplot \-r\fI1:500\fP \-s\fIxo \fB\-e\fI5,6,15,19 file1 file2\fR
makes a scatter plot (using the letter \fIx\fP for file1 and the
letter \fIo\fP for file2) of element 5 versus element
6 in \fIfile1\fP and of element 15 versus element 19
in \fIfile2\fP across the record range 1 to 500. The plot is
displayed on the graphics terminal.
