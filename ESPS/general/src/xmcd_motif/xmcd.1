.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I Xmcd
reads plot data in Unix Graphic Primitive String (GPS) format and displays
the plot in an X window display.  The program emulates a subset of the functions
of the Masscomp program of the same name.
.I Xmcd
is intended to be invoked in a
.IR xterm (1)
window and creates a new window for the plot.
.PP
.I Xmcd
includes the function of the ESPS Masscomp \fIrange\fR program.   
This feature supports the selection of a
range from the plot, zooming in, zooming out, and calling the ESPS play
program on sections of the plot.  See the \fB\-R\fR and the \fB\-P\fR
options below.
Normally
these features are only used by the ESPS script that implements 
\fIplotsd(1\-ESPS)\fR.
.PP
.I Xmcd
uses the X window system calls, and remains active after drawing
the plot.  This is so that the plot can be resized, refreshed, or moved.
If you want to regain control of the shell window without removing the plot
window, then be sure to run \fIxmcd\fR as a subprocess by putting a
\fB&\fR after the command.
.PP
Output from the programs
.IR mlplot (1\-ESPS)
and
.IR genplot (1\-ESPS)
can be displayed with
.I xmcd;
files written by the Masscomp
.IR plot (1G)
program and the graphics editor
.IR ged (1G)
are also acceptable input.
The ESPS programs
.IR plotsd (1\-ESPS),
.IR plotspec (1\-ESPS),
.IR mlplot (1\-ESPS),
and
.IR genplot (1\-ESPS)
use
.I xmcd
internally to implement their
.B \-Tmcd
option.
.PP
If
.I file.gps
is `\-' or is omitted, standard input is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-xtoolkitargs
Standard X11 command line arguments.  See X(1), Xt(3).  An example would
be "-geometry 100x100+0+0". These arguments should be given prior to any
xmcd(1) specific arguments.
.TP
.BI \-r " region"
Scale the plot so that graphing region number
.I region
just fits in the window.
Valid values are 1\-25.
.TP
.B \-u
Scale the plot so that the entire graphing universe
just fits in the window.
.PP
The
.B \-r
and
.B \-u
options are mutually exclusive.
The default behavior, in case neither is selected,
is to scale the plot so that the actual plot just fits in the window.
.TP
.BI \-R
Cause \fIxmcd\fR to go into \fIselect/range\fR mode, after drawing the plot.  
This mode is used with some plot programs (\fIplotsd\fR(1\-ESPS)) and is
called directly by the ESPS plot program.  
When used this way, \fIxmcd\fR
allows the user to select a range from a sampled data plot that is currently 
displayed and to enter that range into the
ESPS Common file.  
It can also be used with \fIplotsd\fR and \fIplay\fR as an interactive
plot/play program.
.TP
.BI \-P
If the \fB\-P\fR option is used, then \fIxmcd\fR will call the
\fIplay\fR program, instead of just saving the selected range
when the middle button is pressed in \fIrange mode\fR.  This causes the
selected range to by played (assuming of course, that your system has
playback capability and the ESPS \fIplay\fR program has been correctly
configured).  When \fIplay\fR returns, if the mouse has not been moved,
pressing the middle button again will save the range into Common.
If the mouse has moved, then the program simply remains in
\fIrange mode\fR.
.PP
The ESPS Common file is updated whenever the plot is redrawn (zoom
in or out), or when a segment is played.   This could be useful when
running \fIplotsd/xmcd\fR in one window and another ESPS program that
uses Common in another window.
The top line of the display always tells what the mouse buttons will do
in each mode.
To exit at anytime, use the \fIquit\fR menu button.
.TP
.BI \-p " play options"
This character string is passed to the \fIplay\fR program on its command
line, each time \fIplay\fR is called.   Enclose the etire argument in
quotes.
.TP
.BI \-i " icon_name"
This option gives the name of a built in icon to be used when the plot
is iconicized.    The built in icons are EPI, SINE, SPEC, IMAGE, and HIST.
.TP
.BI \-x " level"
Print debugging messages to standard error\-more messages at higher levels.
The default is 0 (no messages).
.PP 
In most cases, these options are used by other ESPS programs and not
used directly by user's.   See the \fIplotsd\fR(1\-ESPS) script for an
example of the usage of this program.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
No ESPS parameter file is read.
.SH ESPS COMMON
The following items are read from the ESPS Common file:
.IP
.I "beginplot - integer"
.IP
This is the x-coordinate position at the origin of the graph.
.sp
.I "endplot - integer"
.IP
This is the x-coordinate position at the end point of the graph.
.PP
The following items are written into the ESPS Common file:
.IP
.I "start - integer"
.IP
The left point in the range selected.
.sp
.I "nan - integer"
.IP
The number of points in the selected range.
.PP
The ESPS Common file is updated everytime \fIplay\fR or \fIplotsd\fR is
called by \fIrange\fR.
.PP
ESPS Common processing may be disabled by setting the environment variable
USE_ESPS_COMMON to "off" (though it would be pointless to do so when using
this program).  The default ESPS Common file is
.espscom in the user's home directory.  This may be overidden by setting
the environment variable ESPSCOM to the desired path.  User feedback of
Common processing is determined by the environment variable ESPS_VERBOSE,
with 0 causing no feedback and increasing levels causing increasingly
detailed feedback.  If ESPS_VERBOSE is not defined, a default value of 3 is
assumed.
.SH "ESPS HEADERS"
.PP
No ESPS file headers are read or written.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
No parameter file is read.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
plotsd(1\-ESPS), plotspec(1\-ESPS), mlplot(1\-ESPS), plotspec(1\-ESPS)
.SH "FUTURE CHANGES"
.PP
Implement more of the GPS primitives and expand to a more general
GPStool.
.PP
Make the \fB-i\fR option take a filename to an icon.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
.nf
usage: xmcd [\-r region][\-u][-R][-P][-p][\-x level] [file.gps]
xmcd: unexpected end of file.
xmcd: can't open \fIfilename\fP: \fIreason\fP
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Only a minimal set of the GPS primitives is implemented.
