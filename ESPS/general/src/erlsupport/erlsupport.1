.SH "NAME"
.nf
erlsupport \- send a support request to ERL.
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
erlsupport
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIErlsupport\fR allows you to create a support request form that helps ensure
quick and accurate support by Entropic Research Laboratory (ERL) engineers.
Note that the form editor has not been ported to all architectures that
ERL supports for ESPS/waves+.  If it hasn't been ported, then erlsupport
will just print out the information that you can use to contact us
and help us support you.
.PP
You may email the form directly to ERL, or print the form for faxing
or mailing, or both.  The form may also be email carbon copied to
whoever you want to see it.
.PP
Initial data for the form is created via an data entry screen that
gets information that any problem or support request will require.
You may then edit the form with the editor of your choice, prior
to it's being emailed or printed.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The file \fI$ESPS_BASE/lib/erlsupport.defs\fR contains standard definitions
that \fIerlsupport\fR uses.  It is a Bourne shell script (sh(1)).  You may
edit it to set whatever defaults you like.  Make sure to keep a backup
of the original, in case the defaults you like break \fBerlsupport\fR.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fIErlsupport\fR has no options.

.SH FUTURE CHANGES
.PP
An X-Window's version would be nice.
.PP
.SH ERRORS AND DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
\fBErlsupport\fI uses the program \fBmail\fI for email. If it can't find
mail, or \fI$ESPS_BASE/bin/sf\fR then it will terminate. If your system 
desn't have mail, then edit the \fIerlsupport\fR script to use a mail
program you do have.  Don't hesitate to call ERL if you have trouble.

.SH BUGS
