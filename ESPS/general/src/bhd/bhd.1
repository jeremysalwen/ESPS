.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.I Bhd
reads an ESPS file (\fIinfile\fR), chops the header from the data,
discards the header, and writes the data to \fIoutfile\fP.  If the
\fB-h\fP is used, \fIbhd\fP instead discards the data and writes 
the header to \fIoutfile\fP.  
.PP
When used without \fB-h\fP, \fIbhd\fP allows the contents of an ESPS
file to be passed to non-ESPS programs (For a table giving the binary
data format, use \fIfea_element\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).)  If you 
want to pass the data to non-ESPS programs in ASCII format, use 
\fIpplain\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).  
.PP
When used with \fB-h\fP, \fIbhd\fP yields pure-header files that may
be useful as external ESPS references in the headers of other files.
(See \fIaddgen\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).)
.PP
The \fB-F\fR option causes a foreign header to be retained on the output
file, if one is present.  In most cases, such a foreign header would
have been included in the ESPS file by the use of the \fB-F\fR option
on either \fIaddfeahd\fR(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) or \fIbtosps\fR(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).   
However, the foreign header could also have been saved by a user
written program. 
.PP
If the \fB-F\fR option is used with the \fB-h\fR option, then the
foreign header is written to the output file following the ESPS header.
If the \fB-F\fR option is used without the \fB-h\fR option, then the
foreign header is written to the output file before the data.
.PP
If infile = "\-", standard input is read;
if outfile = "\-", standard output is written.
.PP
If the input file is in EDR format a warning is printed on those
machines where the native machine format is not the same as EDR.  In
these cases, the output file might not be very useful.  The file can
first be converted to native format if necessary.
.SH "ESPS HEADERS"
.PP
This program ignores all header items.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
This program does not access the parameter file.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-h
Produce a header-only ESPS file in \fIoutfile\fP.  
.SH "EXAMPLE(S)"
.PP
Suppose you need to check that two versions of a program are writing
identical output data, though there may have been header changes.
Do the following with output files from the two programs.
.LP
.BI bhd " file.1  file.1.nh "
.br
.BI bhd " file.2  \- | " "cmp " "\- file.1.nh"
