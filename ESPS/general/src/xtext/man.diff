.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIxtext\fP assumes that \fIcommand_line\fP is a full unix command
line for any program that produces ASCII text output.  \fIxtext\fP
runs the \fIcommand_line\fP, puts the output into a temporary file,
and pops up an X Window containing the file contents.  The resulting
window is scrollable and includes a "find" button to facilitate
browsing.  The window can be split horizontally (with independent
scrollbars).  Unless the \fB-L\fP option is used, \fIxtext\fP will
delete the temporary file when it exits.  The temporary file
is by default located in /usr/tmp, but this location can be 
changed by setting the \fIunix\fP environment variable ESPS_TEMP_PATH.
.PP
The \fB-F\fP option permits the display of an existing text file
(rather than of the output from \fIcommand_line\fP.  If this option is
used, the \fIcommand_line\fP cannot be given, and the \fB-L\fP option
has no effect (i.e., the file is never deleted).  
.PP
The window and icon titles can be set directly via the \fB-t\fP and
\fB-i\fP options.  The default titles depend on on whether or not the
\fB-F\fP option is used; if \fB-F\fP is used, the default window and
icon titles are both set to \fIfile_name\fP; if \fB-F\fP is not used,
the default window title is set to the \fIcommand_line\fP followed by
the temporary file name (in parentheses), and the default icon title
title is set to the first item in the \fIcommand_line\fP (usually the
name of the program being run from within \fIxtext\fP).
.PP
Window position can be specified by means of the the standard XView
\fB-Wp\fP and standard X11 \fB-geometry\fP options.  
.PP
\fIxtext\fP can be used in shell scripts to provide window-oriented
displays to the user.  
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-t " window_title"
Specifies that the string \fIwindow_title\fP be used in the title bar
of the displayed window.  
.TP
.BI \-i " icon_title"
Specifies the title to use for the window icon.  
.TP
.BI \-F " file_name"
Specifies that the contents of the existing file \fIfile_name\fP
should be displayed (rather than of the output from
\fIcommand_line\fP).  If this option is used, the \fIcommand_line\fP
cannot be given.  The \fIfile_name\fP may be a full path or a partial
path relative to the current directory.  If \fIunix\fP environment
variables are contained in the path (e.g., $HOME), they are expanded
properly.  If $ESPS_BASE appears in the path and is not defined 
as an environment variable, it is expanded automatically to the 
to base ESPS directory (same one as found by \fIget_esps_base\fP
(1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1)). 
.TP
.BI \-L 
Specifies that the temporary file (containing the \fIcommand_line\fP
output) be left in place.  (Note that the file name is given in the
default window title.)  This option has no effect if \fB-F\fP is used.
.TP
.BI \-x " debug_level \fR[0]\fP"
If \fIdebug_level\fP is positive,
.I xtext
outputs debugging messages. The messages proliferate as
.I debug_level 
increases.  For level 0, there is no output.
.SH "ESPS PARAMETERS"
.PP
The ESPS parameter file is not read by \fIxtext\fP.  
.SH ESPS HEADERS
.PP
No ESPS files are processed by \fIxtext\fP.
.SH ESPS COMMON
.PP
ESPS Common is neither read nor written by \fIxtext\fP. 
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The command
.nf

	%xtext psps -lD foo.fea

.fi
will run \fIpsps\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1) on the file foo.fea and put up a
long listing of the header in a text window.  Similarly,
.nf

	%xtext -t foo.fea fea_stats foo.fea

.fi
will pop up the results of running \fIfea_stats\fP (1\-\s-1ESPS\s+1).
The file name is used in this case as the icon title.  The command
.nf

	%xtext psps -F $HOME/.wave_pro

.fi
will pop up the \fIwaves\fP profile from the user's home directory. 
.PP
Note that aliases provide a convenient means of 
providing versions of ESPS text-producing programs psps that
always pops up the results in a window, for example:
.nf

	%alias pspstool xtext psps 
	%pspstool foo.fea

.fi
.PP
If you are running under Sun`s OpenWindows and the \fIfilemgr\fP, it
can be convenient to use the \fIbinder\fP so that "xtext psps -lD" is
bound to certain file name patterns.   This yields the header in a
pop-up window when you double click on the file's icon.
