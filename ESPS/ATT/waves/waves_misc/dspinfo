# NAME:
#	/etc/dspinfo	Information file for dsp32 boards and
#	software locations.  For each machine with a dsp board,
#	copy this file to /etc and customize.
#
#	DSPDEV - describes dsp board and location of utility programs;
#		see `./src/setrate.c' .  Options are:
#		OLD/NEW : new boards have DAC in addition to codec
#		CODEC/PCM56 : use codec or DAC (NEW only) for D/A
#		FREQ : usually 3072 for old boards, 2048 for new
#		PATH : home of dsp32 up/downsample programs
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Each non-comment line contains the name of an environment
#	variable and its value (exactly two fields).  Value fields
#	must not contain "$XYZ" references, as this file is sometimes
#	read directly by programs.
#	
#	For faster processing, non-comment lines come first in the
#	file so that scanning can stop at the first comment line.
#
#
# FILES:
#	dspinit	- Script used to set environment variables defined in
#		/etc/dspinfo.  See dspinit in /usr/local/bin or
#		$DSP32SL/local/bin for further documentation.
# 
# VARIABLES:
#
#	DSP32SL - root directory of dsp32 Software Library.
#
#	DSP3LIB - home of `libds.a' and `dsp32.h' .
