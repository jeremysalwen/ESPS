This help file contains a brief introduction to xwaves+ operations and
a list of xwaves+ global parameters and commands.  For more information, 
see the full xwaves+ man page.  To do so, run "eman xwaves+" in a
shelltool window or, if you are using X Windows, click on the "xwaves+ 
manual" button in the control panel.

XWAVES+ STARTUP
==============

Xwaves+ starts up with the following steps: 
(1) It checks to see if any optional DSP board is installed (by trying
to open /dev/dsp32).  If a board is found, xwaves+ will use it for
spectrograms and speech output, and all FEA_SD files will be read in
as SHORTs.  If no board is found, xwaves+ will use external ESPS
programs for spectrogram computation and speech output, and it will
not transform the type of FEA_SD files.  

(2) It reads the \fIxwaves\fP+  profile, initializes 
the \fIxwaves\fP+ globals accordingly, and processes an initialization
command file if one is specified in the profile ("init_file").  The 
profile is (in order of precedence) (a) whatever is specified by the -w
option; (b) the file .wave_pro in your home directory; or (c)
$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/.wave_pro.  Any file specified by -w or in the
profile is searched for on the path "$HOME:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves".
The search path used can be overriden by setting the unix environment variable
WAVES_PROFILE_PATH before starting xwaves+.

(3) It processes whatever signal or command files may be listed on the
command line.

XWAVES+ CONTROL PANEL
====================

The values of panel items ending with a colon may be modified by left
mousing (to activate the item) followed by text or numeric input.  Use
<delete> to delete the previous character entered and <CTRL-u> to
remove the entire line.  Any new or changed value must be "entered"
(while activated) by hitting the return key.  The "PAUSE", "CONTINUE,"
"QUIT!," "HELP!", and "xwaves+ manual" items perform the corresponding
functions immediately when moused.  Here are brief explanations of the
panel items.  For details, see the man page.


 INPUTfile:  
      The relative or absolute pathname of a signal to be
      displayed.  A search path ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files" 
      is used, but can be overriden with the environment variable 
      WAVES_INPUT_PATH.  Multiple views on a given file may be 
      established by entering the same file name several times.  
      Files with ESPS headers, NIST (Sphere) headers, AT&T SIGnal 
      headers, no headers, and foreign headers are handled.

 OUTPUTfile:
      Base name of files to be created by the "save
      segment in file" function.  NO CHECK IS MADE FOR
      OVERWRITING EXISTING FILES! A list of all files
      generated during a given run of xwaves+ may be browsed
      by right mousing the OUTPUTfile item.  

 OBJECT name:
     The name by which to refer to a display ensemble.  All
     data views in an ensemble have their time cursors and
     markers synchronized and are treated as a unit during
     interaction and in other respects.  If a new object
     name is specified, subsequently generated data views
     become part of a logically distinct ensemble of signals
     and displays.

  COMMAND(or @file):
     A direct command to the xwaves+ program or to an object
     displayed by xwaves+, or the pathname of a text file
     (preceded by the "@" character) containing commands.
     This item may be changed at any time (even in the middle 
     of execution of a command file).  The default search path
     ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/commands" is used for command files,
     but can be overriden with the environment variable 
     WAVES_COMMAND_PATH.

  PAUSE
     Mousing this item while a command file is running causes the 
     command file to suspend execution, much as though a "pause" 
     command had been encountered in the file.

  CONTINUE
     Mousing this item causes xwaves+ to resume reading from
     a command file after encountering a "pause" in that file (or
     after the PAUSE button has been moused). 

  Attach:
     The name of a function to attach to xwaves+.  The users
     PATH applies. 

  Overlay name:
     The relative or absolute name of a SIGnal formant-bandwidth 
     file or any ESPS FEA file.  Each element of each FEA field is 
     overlayed with a separate track labelled with the field name 
     and element number.  By default, the overlay takes place on 
     the most recently read or computed spectrogram display.  

  HELP
     Mousing this item displays this file. 

  QUIT
     Mousing this item causes xwaves+ to clean up (saving files), 
     return the license, and exit.  

XWAVES+ GLOBALS 
==============

The xwaves+ global parameters can all be initialized at startup from
the .wave_pro file in your home directory.  To change them after 
xwaves+ starts, enter

          set <global name> <global value>

in the space after the "COMMAND(or @file):" prompt in the control
panel, or enter the name of a command file containing a sequence of 
"set" commands.  Here is a list of the current globals, with brief 
descriptions.  For details, see the man page. 

       bg_color
            background color for window frames (6 digits; 2
            each for red, green, blue) (see also fg_color)

       colormap
            file name of an RGB color map (see "COLORMAPS"
            below).  The default search path for colormap
            file names is
            ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/colormaps".  To use a
            different path, set the unix environment vari-
            able WAVES_COLORMAP_PATH before starting
            xwaves+.

       command_step
            Allows the user to single-step through command
            files.  When command_step is non-zero, xwaves+
            prints each command before executing it and
            pauses after its execution (except for "sleep"
            commands).  The next command can then be read
            and executed by mousing CONTINUE in the xwaves+
            control panel.  "Sleep" commands are not
            affected by command_step.  If command_step is
            non-zero and CONTINUE is moused when the next
            command is "sleep", xwaves+ executes the "sleep"
            and then goes on directly to execute the subse-
            quent command; if that command is not a "sleep",
            xwaves+ will pause after its execution.

       ctlwin_iconized
            If this is non-zero, the xwaves+ control window
            is iconized on startup; otherwise the control
            window is displayed on startup.  The default for
            ctlwin_iconized is 0.  Note the standard xview
            command line options -Wi (iconic) and +Wi (open)
            can also be used to determined the initial icon-
            ization state.  Also, the position of the icon
            can be determined by the standard xview command
            line option "-WP <x> <y>".

       ctlwin_x
            x coordinate of upper left of control window

       ctlwin_y
            y coordinate of upper left of control window

       debug_level
            > 0 causes debug messages to be printed.  The
            default value is 0.

       def_header
            filename of a header for use with headerless
            data; the default startup profile
            ($ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/.wave_pro) sets this to
            $ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files/def_head.feasd, which
            is an ESPS FEA_SD header for single-channel,
            SHORT, sampled-data, with sampling rate 8000 Hz.
            A default SIGnal header is in
            $ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files/def_head.sig.  The
            default search path used for default header file
            names is ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files"; this
            can be overriden by setting the unix environment
            variable WAVES_INPUT_PATH before starting
            xwaves+.  If the environment variable DEF_HEADER
            is defined when xwaves+ starts up, its value
            takes precedence over def_header.  Thus, if you
            want def_header to change for different input
            files while xwaves+ is running, then DEF_HEADER
            should not be defined.

       do_color
            0 or 1 to enable B&W or color operation; This
            global is set automatically on startup prior to
            reading the startup profile, so you should set
            it in the profile only if you don't want the
            automatic setting.

       dsp32_wait
            Specifies the number of attempts (at one second
            intervals) that xwaves+ will make to use an
            installed DSP board before giving up.  The
            default is 5.  The purpose of this global is to
            make the temporary use of the board by other
            programs (wplay, wrecord, dspsgram) less
            intrusive to the xwaves+ user.

       edit_ganged
            1 to edit all signals in object, 0 for just one

       fea_sd_special
            1 to treat ESPS FEA_SD files as a special case,
            0 to treat in standard FEA manner.  If
            fea_sd_special == 1, the sampled data from ESPS
            FEA_SD files are read in as SHORTs (regardless
            of their external representation) so that the
            DSP board can be used for spectrograms and D/A.
            In this case, values outside of the range (-
            32768,+32768) are clipped to the extremes of the
            range.  If fea_sd_special == 0, no such conver-
            sions are performed, and the external programs
            sgram_prog and play_prog will be used for spec-
            trograms and D/A.  Fea_sd_special is set on
            startup to 1 or 0 depending respectively on
            whether or not the DSP board is present.

       fg_color
            foreground color for window frames (6 digits; 2
            each for red, green, blue) (see also bg_color)

       first_x
            x coordinate of upper left of first window
            created

       first_y
            y coordinate of upper left of first window
            created

       funcname
            an attached function (like "xlabel" or "xspec-
            trum")

       f0_min
            minimum frequency to display for F0 files

       f0_plot_specs
            plotting method and optional ASCII symbol to
            use.  Argument syntax is: N s xd yd, where N is
            0 or 1, s is the plotting character to use (if N
            is 1), xd and yd are the x and y displacements
            (in pixels) required to center the character.
            If N is 0, F0 is plotted using the usual
            connect-the-dots paradigm.  F0_plot_specs must
            be the last variable set on a command line.

       f0_range
            range in Hz to display for F0 files

       f0_size
            fraction of canvas for plotting F0 for F0 files

       image_clip
            This is used by the digital halftone algorithm
            when spectrograms are displayed on a monochrome
            monitor.  The display algorithm assumes that the
            maximum displayed value MAX is 127.  Values
            between MAX and (MAX -image_clip) are displayed
            in black. The default value is 7 (i.e., in spec-
            trogram terms, everything 7db down from the max-
            imum possible value is shown in black).

       image_range
            This is also used by the digital halftone algo-
            rithm when spectrograms are displayed on a mono-
            chrome monitor.  Everything below (MAX -
            image_clip - image_range) is shown in white.
            The default is 40 (i.e., in spectrogram terms,
            assuming 7 as the value of image_clip, every-
            thing more than 47db down from the maximum pos-
            sible value is shown in white.

       init_file
            The name of a command file to be executed on
            startup.  Execution takes place after all the
            other variable initializations in the profile
            are done, regardless of where in that file the
            definition of init_file occurs.  After the pro-
            file has been processed, redefining the value of
            init_file has no effect other than changing the
            output value for the command "get attributes
            global".  By default, xwaves+ looks for
            init_file along the path
            ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/commands".  The search
            path used can be overriden by setting the unix
            environment variable WAVES_COMMAND_PATH before
            starting xwaves+.

       inputname
            default pathname to appear at "INPUT file"
            prompt

       invert_dither
            If set to non-zero, this causes the display of
            digital-halftone images to appear with black and
            white pixels reversed ("inverse video"). Spec-
            trograms are displayed in digital halftone form
            on monochrome monitors or when do_color is set
            to 0.

       line_type
            plotting algorithm to use for plotting generic
            vector signals.  Default is 1 (line segments
            connect sample points); 2 causes additional
            lines to be drawn from the sample point to the
            minimum value, resulting in a histogram-like
            display).

       left_op
            text corresponding to desired left button opera-
            tion for waveform menus; must be one of:
                               up/down move
                               move closest
                               modify signal
                               repeat previous

       max_buff_size
            determines a limit on the number of bytes of
            storage that xwaves+ will attempt to allocate
            for in-memory data storage for any one signal.
            The value is 2000000 by default, but of course
            can be changed via the startup profile or a set
            command.  If this limit is set high enough for a
            signal to be contained entirely in memory,
            operations such as scrolling through the signal
            will be faster than they would be otherwise,
            since xwaves+ will not have to reread data
            repeatedly from a disk file.  Smaller values of
            the limit may be necessary to prevent xwaves+
            from failing by running out of memory.

       middle_op
            text string corresponding to desired middle but-
            ton operation for waveform menus.  must be one
            of:
                               play between marks
                               up/down move
                               blow up time
                               blow up; function
                               repeat previous
              Note: left_op or middle_op must be the last
              keywords on a command line (only a newline
              should follow their arguments).

       min_spec_height
            minimum height in pixels of spectrogram windows;
            if there are more spectral values per record
            than min_spec_height, the initial window size is
            set at one pixel per spectral value up to a
            pre-defined maximum.

       min_spec_width
            minimum width in pixels of spectrogram windows;
            regardless of window width, spectrograms are
            painted as one record per pixel column.

       nb_spect_params
            file with parameters for "narrowband" spectro-
            grams (see also wb_spect_params).  The default
            search path used is
            ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files"; this can be
            overriden by setting the unix environment vari-
            able WAVES_INPUT_PATH before starting xwaves+.

       objectname
            default name to appear at "OBJECT name" prompt

       options
            hexadecimal magic number; this is an expedient
            for setting various one-bit flags in xwaves+ to
            control debug printouts, data editing and
            display features.  The various functions are
            enabled by the following bits in (hexadecimal)
            options argument:


              0x01 Sets up a special (KLUGE) mode to permit
                   B&W plots suitable for screendump and
                   xeroxing [clear].

              0x04 When editing data (overlaid on spectro-
                   grams, or on time-series plots) the view
                   is always redrawn upon release of the
                   left button following an edit operation.
                   Otherwise the display is only redrawn by
                   explicitly selecting the "redisplay" item
                   in the view's frame menu [set].

              0x08 Disables the saving of spectrogram frag-
                   ments during editing operations [set]

                       release of the
              0x10 Enables immediate writeout of edited data upon
                   left button when editing has been per-
                   formed, provided that the file size is
                   the same as the buffer size [set].
                   (warning: if you clear this, or if you
                   operate on large files, there's a bug
                   that can prevent writing out of edited
                   data even on exit if the input file name
                   has an ".ed" in it).

              0x40 Enables various unpleasant debug prin-
                   touts [clear].

       output_dir
            The name of a writable directory to used for all
            xwaves+ output files.  If output_dir is not
            defined, output files are written in the same
            directory as whatever file they were derived
            from (or in the current working directory if
            there is no source file).  Do not define this
            global unless you want it used, and make sure
            that the named directory exists and is writable.
            If output_dir is defined, all output files from
            xwaves+, xspectrum, and xlabel will go into this
            directory (including edited files, saved file
            segments, spectrogram output files, outputs from
            add_espsf, etc.).  It is OK to include environ-
            ment variables in the path.  In the case of
            external function calls (spectrogram calls via
            sgram_prog, D/A calls via play_prog, as well as
            calls produced by add_espsf, etc.), output_dir
            can be overriden by the value of remote_path or
            remote_output_path.  To "unset" output_dir (so
            that none is used,

              set output_dir ""

       outputname
            default pathname to appear at "OUTPUTfile"
            prompt

       overlayname
            pathname to file which can be overlaid on a
            spectrogram (Note that simply "set"ting this
            name or the three preceding ones does NOT impli-
            citly execute any associated functions; e.g.,
            setting a default inputname does not cause
            xwaves+ to read in the file).

       play_prog
            The name of the D/A play program to use when the
            DSP board is not present or disabled (use_dsp32
            == 0).  The default is "play".  Play_prog can
            have blanks in it, so it can include the specif-
            ication of standard options.  See the discussion
            in "RUNNING ESPS PROGRAMS FROM xwaves+". (see
            also sgram_prog)

       plot_max

       plot_min
            The globals plot_max and plot_min provide a lim-
            ited means of overriding the automatic vertical
            scaling of plot data.  If they are zero (the
            default), for each trace xwaves+ finds the max
            and min in the entire buffer, and scales the
            plot so that the max and min appear at the top
            and bottom of the window (or window region, if
            there are multiple traces).  If plot_max
            (plot_min) is non-zero, xwaves+ will scale every
            new or refreshed plot so that the top (bottom)
            of the window or region corresponds to the fixed
            value.  Values outside of the range are simply
            clipped by the top of the bottom of the display
            window (extending into the scrollbar).  (That
            is, the plots for multiple traces are not lim-
            ited to a region of the window as they are in
            the case of auto-scaling.  Yes, it can get very
            ugly!  Use with care!  Note that the command
            auto_plot_limits provides a convenient means for
            resetting both values to zero.  Note that a 
            different approach to plot scaling is to attach
            the ESPS program \fIclip\fP to the menu via add_espsf, 
            which makes it easy to re-display a segment at full 
            amplitude.  

       readout_bar_height
            height in pixels of the readout bar, which con-
            tains (under X Windows) various digital
            readouts.  The bar is located below the title
            bar and above the scrollbar.  Under Sunview, the
            readout bar is not used, since the readouts are
            inserted into the title bar.

       ref_size
            initial size of the display buffer (seconds)

       ref_start
            default starting time for file display (sec)

       ref_step
            page step size for "page ahead/back" (seconds)

       remote_path
            If this string is defined (and not overriden by
            either remote_input_path or remote_output_path
            as described below), it is prefixed to the
            basename of all input and output file names in
            external calls (play operations, spectrogram
            operations, operations from add_espsX).  This is
            useful for operation in an NFS directory with
            rsh.  If remote_path is defined, it overrides
            output_dir in the case of external calls. See
            the discussion in "RUNNING ESPS PROGRAMS FROM
            xwaves+".

       remote_input_path
            If if remote_input_path is defined, it is pre-
            fixed to the basename of all input file names in
            external calls.  It overrides any definition of
            remote_path.

       remote_output_path
            If remote_output_path is defined, it is prefixed
            to the basename of all output file names in
            external calls.  It overrides definitions of
            remote_path and output_dir

       reticle_grid
            determines whether (1) or not (0) the reticle is
            displayed on spectrogram displays.

       socket_port
            This is the INET domain socket port number to be
            used when xwaves+ is operating as a display
            server (as the result of the -s option or the
            enable_server command).  If set, socket_port
            overrides the WAVES_PORT environment variable or
            the value given by the -p option.

       scrollbar_height
            height of the scrollbar in new windows (pixels)

       scroll_ganged
            1 to scroll all signals in object, 0 for just
            one (see also zoom_ganged)

       sgram_prog
            The name of the spectrogram program to use when
            the DSP board is not present or disabled.  The
            default is "sgram".  Sgram_prog can have blanks
            in it, so it can include the specification of
            standard options.  The default is nil.  See the
            discussion in "RUNNING ESPS PROGRAMS FROM
            xwaves+". (see also play_prog)

       show_labels
            1 to display FEA field names at the left of the
            corresponding parameter track in waveform win-
            dows, 0 to inhibit the display of names.

       show_vals
            1 to display numerical values at the left of
            every parameter track in waveform windows, 0 to
            inhibit the display of values.  The values
            displayed are the parameter values at the cur-
            sor, and they change dynamically as the cursor
            is moved.  If there are a large number of FEA
            fields being displayed, the constant update of
            the parameter values can be time consuming.

       spec_middle_op
            middle_op text string corresponding to desired
            middle button operation for spectrogram menus.
            must be one of:
                               up/down move
                               move contour
                               modify intensity
                               play between marks
                               repeat previous
              Note: spec_left_op or spec_middle_op must be
              the last keywords on a command line (only a
              newline should follow their arguments).

       spec_left_op
            text corresponding to desired left button opera-
            tion for spectrogram menus; must be one of:
                               up/down move
                               move closest
                               mark formants
                               repeat previous

       spect_interp
            1 to cause linear interpolation in rescaled
            spectrogram displays; 0 to disable interpolation
            so that each discreet value is shown as a uni-
            form rectangle; if data are interpolated then
            the range of the interpolated data computed
            together is determined by spect_rescale_scope.

       h_spect_rescale
            1 to cause horizontal rescaling of spectrogram
            displays; 0 to cause fixed displays with 1-pixel
            per data record.

       v_spect_rescale
            1 to cause vertical rescaling of spectrogram
            displays; 0 to cause fixed displays with 1-pixel
            per data record.

       spect_rescale_scope
            determines whether horizontal rescaling of
            interpolated data is computed for the entire
            xwaves+ buffer (value is "buffer") or for just
            the current window width (value is "view").
            Rescaling for the entire buffer can be quite
            slow if the ratio of the current view to the
            entire buffer is large, but has the advantage
            that horizontal scrolling is very fast once the
            new image is computed (since it is stored).
            Rescaling just the current view is faster (and
            is the default), but has the disadvantage that
            the rescaling tapes place every time the
            viewpoint is moved (i.e., scrolling is slower).
            In later releases, this global will also affect
            the rescaling of non-interpolated data.

       temp_path
            determines the directory in which xwaves+ will
            write temporary files (e.g., files generated by
            external ESPS calls that result from xwaves+
            commands add_espsf or add_espst).  The default
            for temp_path is "." (i.e., current working
            directory).

       use_dsp32
            1 to use dsp board, 0 to ignore dsp board; this
            is normally set by xwaves+ on startup depending
            on whether or not the board is detected.

       verbose
            Values > 0 cause various feedback messages to be
            printed.  When verbose > 0, xwaves+ prints a
            startup message indicating the identity of the
            .wave_pro file that was read, and it prints
            copies of the shell command lines used to invoke
            external ESPS functions as well as all shell
            commands that result from calling the xwaves+
            command "shell".  When the shell commands have
            completed, a completion message is printed.
            Unrecognized xwaves+ commands are reported as
            such (for verbose > 0).  When verbose > 1,
            xwaves+ prints detailed feedback about command
            parsing.  The default value of verbose is 1.

       wave_height
            height of new waveform windows

       wave_width
            width of new waveform windows

       wb_spect_params
            file with parameters for "wideband" spectrograms
            (see also nb_spect_params).  The default search
            path used is ".:$ESPS_BASE/lib/waves/files";
            this can be overriden by setting the unix
            environment variable WAVES_INPUT_PATH before
            starting xwaves+.

       write_common
            If write_common is 1, each time the mouse is
            used to change the position of segment markers,
            the file name ("filename"), starting record
            ("start"), and number of records ("nan") are
            written to ESPS Common; if write_common is 0,
            Common is not written.  For more information
            about ESPS Common processing, see various ESPS
            manual pages (e.g., getparam (1-ESPS) and
            read_params (3-ESPS)).

       x_increment
            horizontal displacement between successive win-
            dows

       y_increment
            vertical displacement between successive windows

       xlabel_ctlwin_x
            The X position of the xlabel (attachment) con-
            trol window.

       xlabel_ctlwin_y
            The Y position of the xlabel (attachment) con-
            trol window.

       xspectrum_ctlwin_x
            The X position of the xspectrum (attachment)
            control window.

       xspectrum_ctlwin_y
            The Y position of the xspectrum (attachment)
            control window.

       xspectrum_datwin_forward

            Whether (1) or not (0) the xspectrum data (plot)
            window is brought forward every time a new plot
            is displayed.  The default is 1.

       xspectrum_datwin_height
            The height of xspectrum data (plot) windows.

       xspectrum_datwin_width
            The height of xspectrum data (plot) windows.

       xspectrum_datwin_x

       xspectrum_datwin_y
            These two globals control the initial position
            of the xspectrum data (plot window) if there is
            only one display object.  Positive values for
            xspectrum_datwin_x or xspectrum_datwin_y specify
            respectively the X and Y position of the xspec-
            trum plot window if there is only one display
            object at the time the plot window is displayed.
            If there is more than one display object, the
            xspectrum plot window is aligned with the first
            display window of the corresponding xwaves+
            display object, with the xspectrum display
            directly underneath the left side of the xwaves+
            window.  If xspectrum_data_win_x is negative,
            the top of all xspectrum plot windows is posi-
            tioned directly underneath the first xwaves+
            display window of the corresponding object.  If
            xspectrum_data_win_y is negative, the left side
            of all xspectrum plot windows is lined up (vert-
            ically) with the left side of the first waves+
            display window of the corresponding object.
            This is only effective on startup of xspectrum.

       xspectrum_max_lpc_order
            The maximum order for LPC (maximum entropy)
            spectral estimates in xspectrum.  This item is
            only effective on startup of xspectrum.

       zoom_ratio
            fractional change caused by "zoom" operations

       zoom_ganged
            1 to zoom all signals in object, 0 for just one
            (see also scroll_ganged)

       P8574_type
            1 (default) means correct P8574 version part is
            on the Ariel analog board.    If you get a mes-
            sage like:

            iicack: bus error, sta=0x8, flag=0x0, goodbye!

            when trying to do analog output, then you might
            have an Ariel board with the wrong version
            P8574P on it.  Some have been shipped with the A
            version, which has different addresses.  If you
            get this message, then set this global to 0.

       ARIEL_16
            Specifies which crystal is on the Ariel VME-16 ProPort
            Ariel analog module for the AT&T Surfboard.  Set to 0 (the 
            default), to specify the standard 24 Mhz crystel; set to 1 
            to specify the 16 Mhz crystal. 

XWAVES+ COMMANDS
===============

Xwaves+ commands may be executed by entering them manually in the 
control panel, or by running a command file containing a sequence of 
commands.  The available commands are listed below.  The command name 
is shown on the left followed by a short description enclosed in ">>" 
and "<<" brackets.  Most commands have one or more optional 
attribute-value pairs that follow the command name.  The available
attributes are listed, one-per-line, right after the command.  For
explanations, see the man page.  The following should be used as 
reminders about the commands, not as a means for learning them.
