The analysis/display parameters for hcspect are all at your disposal.
Here's how:

Copy /usr/local/lib/signal/misc/.hcspect_pro to your home directory.
Copy /usr/local/lib/signal/misc/nb_hcspect_params and
     /usr/local/lib/signal/misc/wb_hcspect_params to somewhere handy in
your directory structure.
Edit ~/.hcspect_params so that the variables "wb_spect_params" and
"nb_spect_params" are set to the pathnames of your personal copies of the
corresponding parameter files. (Note that "wb" and "nb" refer to
"narrowband" and "wideband" respectively.)  You might want to examine
the other variable settings in .hcspect_pro also (e.g. wave_height).

Edit your copies of the ...params files to suit your needs.  They are
commented and should be self-explanatory.

Note that some of the parameters in these files may be overridden
when hcspect is invoked by specifying command-line arguments.  Further
documentation is available by running hcspect with NO arguments.
